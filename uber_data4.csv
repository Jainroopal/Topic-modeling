It can be exhilarating for some, but overwhelming for some others.",Very interesting profile. The job requires a lot of on-ground work and there is new challenge everyday. The work environment is very fast paced and there is so much to learn given the few number of employees. Some of the smartest people from all over the country work with you to set you up for success in the company.
147,Worklife Balance can be improved.,"True entrepreneurial culture, passionate & innovative colleagues. Extremely flat organisation structure."
148,The work involves alot of time and talking to drivers.,Lots of responsibility and good package
149,No work / life balance - 16 hour days are common\r\n\r\nQuality of managers is surprisingly bad over the past few months and as a result growth of team members has been severely impacted.,It's amazing to see the product you work on and market start becoming viral and actually changing lives and transportation patterns around you.\r\n\r\nExtremely smart people who are super motivated to make Uber the greatest company on Earth!
150,Long Work Hours apart from that there is not much to complain about.,"Good Exposure, Work culture is excellent. Overall Remuneration is good"
151,Mainly busy Thursday-Sunday \r\nCan not see where you are delivering to until after accepted and you have picked up food.,"Decent tips, make my own schedule, and friendly customers and restaurant staff."
152,Limited growth possibility with the role.,Good colleagues and office vibe.
153,- Uber is doing so much and joining from a startup company was a bit overwhelming\r\n- Hearing and seeing people leave the company (which is very normal for companies at this size and age) was a little hard for a new hire such as me,"- Hiring process: very fast, I got an offer in the same week as my interview and from there it was just a matter of when I want to join\r\n- Revamped culture: I don't see any signs of what I use to hear in the media about the bad culture. I see the whole company pushing the new norms and focusing on diversity and inclusion\r\n- The mission: Uber has a great potential to letterly move the world\r\n- Talent in the company: I'm yet to see someone who is not well qualified for their role and I have learned so much from my teammates already\r\n- Transparency: the management is always eager to hear what employees have to say and respond to all the hard questions that they ask. this definitely was not the case in my previous company when it came to compensations and financials of the company\r\n- Compensation: Very competitive and I love the package structure they have with cache and stock bonuses."
154,The career path is not very clear but you see many growth opportunities at the same time (like changing teams or locations),"Great salary, perks, and working conditions. The team is very welcoming and talented."
155,"Hours/amount of work can sometimes be overwhelming. Nothing crazy, but just slightly more than preferred, at times.","Competitive salary and compensation, very generous perks (amazing maternity/paternity leave, health benefits, opportunities to invest in your career).\r\n\r\nMeaningful work that touches millions of people's lives every day."
156,It's really difficult to ask for courses that are not imparted by the company.\r\nDoesn't have a graduate program,"It's very fun, multicultural, has free food and snacks, there a lot team bonding activities, has a good workbalance"
157,there are no 401k contributions and the pay is less competitive than other tech companies in NYC,"Free food and uber credits are pretty awesome.  The culture is great, my role is very autonomous.  There are lots of activities and top-notch benefits  Uber offers.  And most importantly there is a lot of room for growth more than I've seen in any other company"
158,Coolness is not in the uber vocabulary,Cool way to go place in a nice area
159,There are really no major downsides to join the new São Paulo Tech Center office for engineers looking to make a difference.,"Although Uber is now a public global company with thousands of engineers and employees, there's still a start-up mentality in which you have lots of autonomy, can move fast and question the status-quo. The internal culture is extremely healthy with high energy and very intelligent people all around. The office in São Paulo is amazing and the food is great."
160,"Rest-and-vest behavior for lots of senior employees, process for performance/promotion very inefficient, lots of inexperienced managers.","Awesome culture, excellent WLB, strong engineering with lots of interesting issues to solve for our users and for our internal teams."
161,"The job can be time consuming, but not to an extreme.","The people are understanding and helpful. The perks (lunch is provided, snacks and drinks are always available, benefits and PTO are top notch). The job itself is also fulfilling."
162,Uber takes care of their worker. No cons,"The pay, benefits and off on Sundays"
163,"For this role as a recruiter - It's a hard job. Just trying to help people to understand that this is a great place to work can be a challenge. Also, the technical bar expected for hiring of engineers is high.","Really great community of people here at Uber. Everyone is very smart, thoughtful, and accepting here which is amazing. From day one your voice is heard, and your opinion is taken into consideration. The work life balance is amazing. Management here truly understands that there is a life outside work - And they encourage you to live it. The unlimited paid time off is actually used - No one ever gives you a hard time for taking a vacation or some time away for yourself. The support system is unmatched. Everyone truly cares about your success, and will always offer to help you out - whether personally or professionally."
164,Management\r\nTransparency\r\nGuidelines \r\nSalary\r\nEmployees structure\r\nHR structure,Exiting\r\nFlexibility\r\nTechnology \r\nYoungness\r\nBig bold Bets\r\nPerseverance
165,Getting paid could take long,There was never a dull moment
166,"Some groups are not part of the core Rideshare teams and are, as such, semi-isolated by communications and initiatives. But, to be fair, it's a huge, global company.","One of the core pillars the Executive Leadership Team focuses on is Employee Retention. I've never experienced that before. They spend a lot of effort working on ways to keep employees, happy, engaged, and recognized."
167,Low job salary\r\nSo many uber drivers,I got to know the city very well\r\nI got to meet new people
168,Not the best structure for learning &amp; development,Great company mission—will keep you motivated
169,I wish i could drive and be employed by UBER. I love them both,I love how many  people we help in the world
170,It's a low margin market and any new player with money can basically force all players to drop their margins and go all in with the price-war.,Good leadership turnaround from Dara. Love the company's general treatment of employees.
171,You need to be comfortable with uncertainty and things need to change every few months. If you are someone who needs a consistent structure this place is not for you.,It is clear that the leadership team at Uber cares about employee retention and general happiness. I am very happy with the transparent and non-hierarchical structure here.
172,It's in San Francisco.  Finding a place to stay in the city that is affordable is a challenge.,"Good pay, great benefits, good energy, engaging work, and amazing people."
173,Some of the processes can be very time consuming.,Helps supplement income in between jobs or during slow times.
174,The only opportunities for advancement that open up are in Sydney or overseas. Not a great place to work if you're looking to advance a career within Brisbane.  Roles are casual to start with and hours are not always freely available.,"Uber is a really supportive environment, particularly in the Brisbane office.  Management culture is fantastic and they really foster open channels of communication regarding performance. Positive and constructive feedback are both offered regularly. There's a real sense of respect from management towards employees. Customer service representatives are encouraged to put in 110% to make sure we are offering the best possible service, which makes taking pride in work easy to do. Great job to have around study or other life priorities that take a lot of time."
175,"Overtimes are possible, job security is low","A lot of interesting projects, piloting products."
176,"Get ready to become a professional at multi-tasking! Projects, Internal clubs, and training sessions on top of your daily work is a lot to take on!",Customers and Drivers are our top priority. Leading new initiatives to improve user experience has been a thrill. The Account Management Organization at Uber Freight is constantly changing making it an extremely exciting and fast paced environment that never gets boring!
177,Workload can be tensed during peak hours.,Management  is always there for help.
178,-During the out of school season its hard to make even $10 an hour.\r\n-Uber takes a 25% off the top rate of every ride.\r\n-Long hours collecting tax receipts and recording mileage logs. \r\n-If tax benefits were not in place Uber would not be worth it.,"-Flexible hours.\r\n-Good money during busy times (concerts, events).\r\n-Networking opportunities.\r\n-Good money during school season."
179,"A fast paced environment is not for everyone, to succeed you need to be autonomous, hard working, confident, and committed.","Uber has a fast paced, creative and collaborative culture. You will have the opportunity to be involved with many exciting projects and tasks with passionate and enthusiastic people. Everyone is talented, supportive and wants to do their best!"
180,overall I am satisfied with Uber and working at Uber.,"Career path,Compensations &amp; Benefits,Culture,Work balance."
181,i dont know of any,"very good work culture, easy to grow,  we do the right thing."
182,Not bad feedback to provide at this time.,Strong commitment and wide knowledge
183,Lack of communication with the back office.,"Part-time, Teamwork, Training,  great work environment."
184,None at this time.,"Uber has been a tremendous place to work.  Young atmosphere with strong leadership enabling employees to get the most out of each day. The benefits package are second to none (breakfast, catered lunches, Uber rides/eats)."
185,Little progression available tends to be based on length of service rather then work ethic.  Poor Management very little feedback or direction given to employees. Work can become monotonous and repetitive.,"Starting salary is quite good. Good benefits - health insurance, wellness benefits such as gym membership."
186,I have been working with Uber never found down side,Uber has flexibility and security for driver and passengers
187,"A big portion of the comp package is equity, so depending on how you view that it could be seen as a negative.","This is a good place to work if you like the feel of a startup but want the benefits of a big company. A few specific things you get from this job:\r\n-- ability to work with a lot of data and hone data skills (i.e. excel analysis and SQL, among others)\r\n-- ability to carve your own career path (it's normal for people to move teams and/or offices if you want)\r\n-- ability to make a difference (a change you make could result in +$1m revenue increase for the company within a week)\r\n-- ownership over your role (ability to make decisions and implement them yourself quickly)"
188,"Not a lot of diversity, talking about professional and scholar experience.","Uber will amaze more than you think, the process that I lived was amazing! Know from the inside I can see why Uber invest a lot of time/money in all the recruitment process. It's amazing to work with such amazing and intelligent people. On three months I learn a lot!"
189,"If you're good enough but in it solely for the money, then you're at the wrong address. \r\n\r\nThe process from application to hire/onboarding is really long, but it ensures your colleagues are strong enough to fit in.\r\n\r\nDepending on country, there's a stigma \","Incredible network. You'll instantly have access to tons of high-caliber people around the world with all sorts of backgrounds. It's very much like gaining another top-MBA network. And what's best is, they all want to collaborate!\r\n\r\nIt's a startup environment, but safer and with enough corporate flair. \r\n\r\nYou'll have a lot of opportunities to distinguish yourself and grow vertically and horizontally."
190,"1) Compensation is WAY below market - you are here because you love working here, surely not for the money\r\n2) Start-up hangover - people who have been here for a while have risen to the top; they might not have the right skills or experience \r\n3) Need to figure out HR basics (goal setting, performance assessment, etc.)","1) Great company culture - people want to do the right thing\r\n2) Super smart people - haven't yet someone I wasn't impressed by\r\n3) Lots of growth opportunities - the business is growing, so you will too!\r\n4) Interesting problems to solve - no one else is doing this work (or very few are)"
191,"Work load, work life balance","Culture, Work flexibility, Office set up, team"
192,"Company doesn't match 401k, hope some day company will look into it.",1.  Awesome work and technology\r\n2.  Free food and lots of snacks\r\n3.  At par compensation\r\n4.  Awesome benefits \r\n5.  Awesome leadership team.\r\n6. Great vision\r\n7. Employee discount on Uber and UberEats
193,- This is a tough market. Will Uber continue to execute toward a path to profitability?,"- Clear market leader in a space with huge upside, competitors will struggle to compete in the long-term\r\n- \"
194,"- Pay is on the low, low end compared to other jobs. Similar job titles at other companies are paying $15-20k more a year to start.\r\n- Inexperienced management.\r\n- Questionable hiring practice.\r\n- Losing progression opportunities within the company very quickly.\r\n- Becoming restrictive, causing a drop in morale that all but managers themselves could see.","- Good benefits.\r\n- Catered lunches, snacks and drinks provided for free.\r\n- Quiet office environment."
195,"If you're not used to a start-up environment, you'll need to prepare yourself for the volatility of things changing extremely quickly - process changes, product updates, compliance/legal workflow, etc.",\
196,Too much overtime expected. \r\n70+ hour work weeks. \r\nWeekend and overnight work expected. \r\nNo personal time. \r\nExecutives in the Toronto atg office are not willing to hear criticism of their working habits and cause road blocks for others work. \r\nTerrible communication. \r\nNo respect for workers because the executives feel they are above everyone else. \r\nUntimely responses to emails and chats causing work delays. \r\nDirect person I supported was also my manager so had no assistance with complaints. \r\nNo training because the Toronto office is a satellite. \r\nWas sent to Pittsburgh for training but couldnt pay attention because of constant workflow. \r\nYou will always feel like you are talking to a wall when dealing with the executives. \r\nThey do nothing to build personal relationships with coworkers.,Excellent pay.\r\nOvertime.\r\nExcellent benefits. \r\nCasual atmosphere. \r\nBrilliant coworkers.
197,You wreck your car. You wreck your body. You don't get paid what you think you will. They customer service for drivers is a joke.,"You can money if you are desperate, mentally, ill, have to set your own schedule around work, kids, school, caring for a loved one, etc.. other than that DONT DO IT!"
198,Very difficult to get inside,"Free food, perks, cheap taxi, great office"
199,- Lower pay\r\n- Internal messaging tools need work,- Always something new we're working on\r\n- Super helpful people\r\n- Impact of work easily seen\r\n- Promotions are fair and easier than at other companies\r\n- Well known brand\r\n- Great medical and Uber product benefits
200,Tough market to compete in.,"Benefits, Pay, work life balance."
201,You get paid £2.50 per hour in some areas in London as you get one job. \nSo many riders/drivers that leads to a less jobs for all drivers\nUber doesn’t tell you how much they are going to pay you per drop until you finish the job Stuart and Deliveroo at least they tell you how much they gonna pay you before you accept the job!,You can choose when to work\nYou get paid on time every week
202,"The onboarding can be improved,  Not having your own desk can be annoying some days, No excel skills and you will find it hard to work at Uber whatever position you are.","Great place to develop, great perks and benefits,  Lovely atmosphere at the office,  Multi culturel, great get-together events,"
203,You get spoiled by the perks very quickly. Stay grateful!,- great pay and benefits\r\n- great work environment\r\n- strong workplace community
204,Can't think of any Cons.,"1.Have good platform for you to explore world class technologies.\r\n2.Products are customer facing so it's fun.\r\n3.Culture is good, people are nice and driven."
205,None that I known of,"I love my job, great working environment. Amazing group of people. There's no place I'd rather be"
206,Depending on department can be overworked and overused,"Good package, executive experience is vast"
207,- Highly competitive environment\r\n- Constant improvisation\r\n- Top management lack of vision/experience\r\n- Disorganization\r\n- Boring work environment,- Prepared team\r\n- Nice perks\r\n- Benefits\r\n- Stock Options
208,Easy to get too busy and to stay at the office too long,"Breadth of projects spanning analytics, program management, product team interactions, and global team/travel"
209,No complaints at this time,"Perks, innovative and positive atmosphere, ability to work on cutting edge solutions with the best and brightest from around the world!"
210,There are none!! I love my job!!,"Culture is great, perks are awesome! i love coming to work every day and this company really values their employees and reward them when hard work is done. I love this company and will never leave."
211,A lot of negative news about the company,It is an incredible place to develop yourself and help to change the world's motion
212,"If you struggle to work autonomously and respond poorly to change, it’ll be a struggle.","Culture is incredible, opportunity to move\r\nInto new roles, autonomy to take on and own projects, catered lunch provided, CEO is inspiring, product innovations daily."
213,10 leave credits per year only\r\nShifting schedule,Good environment\r\nNice colleagues\r\nGreat perks and benefits\r\n*Free Food (unlimited snacks and 1 full course meal)\r\n*Transportation Allowance\r\n*Health card (250k per illness per year)\r\n* Performance incentives
214,NA NA NA NA NA,Pay - Above average\r\nBenefits - Free food\r\nEnvironment - Friendly and lenient
215,"Work life balance is not good. People are aggressive. Well, the company culture is aggressive.",You can learn and grow really fast at Uber.
216,I can't see any at the moment,- Engineering best practices\r\n- Mentors\r\n- Positive &amp; Friendly co-workers \r\n- High compensation / salary \r\n- Beautiful campus \r\n- Healthy food &amp; snacks\r\n- Uber / Uber Eats credits\r\n- Flexible work hours - you choose what times to be in the office
217,I honestly have nothing negative to say regarding working for Uber Freight!,"I love working for this company. They love to promote from within, and make sure to provide you with the skills necessary to advance. They are also very transparent, and keep their employees engaged in all of aspects of the business. Did I mention free breakfast and lunch everyday? Great place to work!"
218,Signed an NDA..... If you only knew!!!!!,Work life balance is great
219,"Working with angry drivers yelling in your face, very inflexible, people looking at everything you do every second.","great work community, provides amazing benefits."
220,Ongoing changes in the health care space,"Amazing teams and culture - Challenging, interesting and impactful work - Very transparent company"
221,I wish we could not wear  uniform or at least something more professional.,"Benefits and Schedule, I love the catering everyday."
222,"Definitely find myself working very long hours some days. Also, things change extremely quickly which can be good sometimes, but other times causes for a bit of confusion.","Everyone I'm surrounded by is impressively intelligent and brings their own zest to the table. Uber really encourages employees to find their passion and work that passion into their work. You're trusted to work flexibly with the assumption that you're getting everything done.\r\nOther benefits: free breakfast/lunch, snacks, coffee. Unlimited/encouraged PTO."
223,"when we drive motorbike, and it rains a lot, the visibility is bad",very good job because we are always working with people side by side
224,"Uber is terrible at change management, and can’t figure out how it wants to structure the company. I’ve been through 6+ reorgs in the 1.5 years at the company. In two of these reorgs it was counter goals to the previous one (hire more decentralized offices &gt; centralize in 2 cities, etc.). If Uber wants to be treated like an established company post-IPO, it’s leadership team needs to step it up and learn the basics of change management.","The benefits are fantastic (free lunches, unlimited PTO, monthly Uber credits).  You can move up and get opportunity as a young person, which I found wasn’t as true at Amazon (age-ist). It’s relatively easy to move internationally."
225,- Have to think about comp in a wholistic way as salary is average\r\n- Unknown as to how things will change given IPO,- Good work culture\r\n- Diverse employee group\r\n- Good orientation to set you up for success\r\n- Much focus on ensuring employees get up to speed and learn to thrive here\r\n- Travel and growth opportunities
226,-you get PTO but can't use it because they keep on loosing employees\r\n-cant trust management to keep confidential information to themselves\r\n-drivers can talk to you anyway they please and get away with it (yes anything) security is there but doesn't hear much due to his headphones\r\n-if you are friends with management you get priority treatment\r\n-face muscles hurt after work because no smile equals low rating (yes. Drivers get to rate you) and that means eventual termination.\r\n-can only wear Uber shirts. \r\n-dont even get me started on HR..,-The pay and quarterly bonuses. \r\n-your acting skills improve over time\r\n-your problem solving skills improve
227,"They pay can be higher, but it's definitely market rate.","Working in a big company you can feel that you're just a number on the payroll, not at Uber. I truly feel valued here at the company. The training, L&amp;D, and the benefits here are amaaazziiiing. Never leaving. Also, my boss is the best human being on this planet. Upper management is A1 (at least in recruiting)"
228,No fixed wages and no superannuation nothing,Flexible shift timings to work
229,Horrible outsourced chat support always,Allowance for uber eats good
230,"Don't expect compensation to dazzle you. Come here if you're excited to build and work with your teams, and. grow your career in a way you can't even imagine. Do not come here if money is your P0.  You will always be disappointed \r\n\r\nCareer Pathing - do not expect the certainty of banking/consulting promos (e.g. - 2 years and next level guaranteed etc). While we now have competencies and ladders roled out (finally!), it's very much a lattice framework in terms of career navigation. If you're ok with that, Uber is heaven as the opportunities are truly abundant. If you're not,  Uber is uncertain and frustrating.","People, people, people. Assume good intent, smart, hardworking, funny. I go to work every day because of them and they will  be my friends long after i leave. \r\n\r\nQuality of work - So many fun challenges to solve. If you find one,  run! and everyone supports you there. \r\n\r\nManagement: This is perhaps my personal experience. Uber has done a ton to train up managers (when I joined, lots of young first time managers who didn't understand the difference b/w IC and people mgmt.  That has since changed a TON or the better). Lots more structure around development conversations and 1:1s. In my  experience, Uber management  empowers you to chase the problems you find interesting (as long as there is business need) -- and are very supportive of folks internally . navigating the . company to find . the next role if the. current team isnt  a good fit \r\n\r\nCareer Trajectory and Navigation -- You can run in directions you can't even imagine in! I've had 3 roles over my past 4 years, worked across operations, strategy, analytics, growth marketing, process optimization . with even a stint in People Development.  I've . had to \"
231,I don't see any downsides.,This is a happy workplace to be with because of kind colleagues and lovely work environment.
232,Very little paid time off,"Free lunch, good compensation, good benefits"
233,There are not many cons besides not being in love with staring at a computer screen all day.,"Fun environment, great perks, everyone is there to help each other"
234,- Starting to feel like a corporate in terms of processes\r\n- Org structure is still evolving\r\n- Compensation is low compared to street value\r\n- Poor work life balance,- Internal mobility \r\n- Smart people to work with\r\n- Really interesting business problems\r\n- Strong mission statement
235,"Lots of politics, high variance in competency within the company, work life balance is tough to manage with the work load, have to be open to work at any time, compensation is painfully average","Great benefits, flexible hours depending on rank and designation, nice office"
236,No cons at all for this company,Really enjoyed my time there!
237,* Media cycles sometimes drive the internal company sentiments,* Meaningful work\r\n* Smart peers\r\n* Very competitive salary
238,- Uber is always under a lot of scrutiny in media and politics so we have to tread carefully as a company in anything we do and think many times before implementing new initiatives,"- Amazing teams and culture\r\n- Great professional development programs in place and many more in development\r\n- Challenging, interesting and impactful work \r\n- Very transparent company"
239,The culture is toxic. Do not recommend this company to anyone. Some of the managers on the user experience team are completely incompetent in their role. Favoritism is a huge problem within the team.,Good opportunity to learn new skills and take proactive steps to further your career.
240,No downside on my end.,"Hospitality, atmosphere, location, snacks, drinks."
241,"Once Uber got big (ie: 10k+ employees), they really have a hard time tracking what ppl do and should be “cutting the fat” of ppl with no impact a lot sooner.\r\n\r\nEarly employees got paid poorly for the amount of work it took to grow the company (can’t speak to what employees make now), but who cares, it was all worth it for the stock!",Fast-paced quick results-type of work. Uber is a special place where “best ideas win” and you are able to make changes/innovate and see results quickly.  Work-life balance was tough in the early days (necessary) and got to a very comfortable state later on.  The ppl they surround you with at Uber are legends. Truly some of the smartest ppl I’ve ever had the pleasure being around. Uber changed my life and I highly recommend it as a place to work. From TK (the man!) to Dara....this place is still a rocketship taking off.
242,* Uber receives a lot of attention in the news. When it's not positive - it can be discouraging,"* I strongly believe in the company's mission. While other top tech companies are all competing to steal your time, Uber is giving you the time back by getting you/things/food from point A to point B as fast as possible.\r\n* Almost everyone I know uses our products and it feels great to know how it works internally and to be able to influence its future.\r\n* A lot of interesting challenges with plenty of opportunities to have impact\r\n* Great team"
243,"There is a decent amount of technical debt due to moving fast, so data and tooling can hamstring projects and lead to hacky solutions.  I think Uber is in a transitional state of figuring out to how to operate at scale with excellence, so I don't think this is a permanent problem.  The company is changing rapidly so it can feel a bit like getting whiplash as priorities shift from week-to-week, but as long as you can roll with the punches you'll do well.","Uber is fast-paced and gives you the opportunity to take on responsibility quickly as you build a cool product. The Seattle office has a great work culture where it feels like a startup but you actually get to work normal hours.  I'm typically in the office from 8:30a-5:00p, and I tend not to work in the evenings or on the weekends.  My colleagues are bright, friendly, and supportive, and the office's site managers do a stellar job of making this a fun environment to work in.  There are several employee-led groups focused on anything from diversity to beer-tasting. Lunch, snacks, and drinks are free, and the office is in a beautiful location overlooking Elliot Bay.  The company's culture seems to have undergone a heavy overhaul, and my concerns about working in a difficult or toxic environment (based on recent press) have thankfully been completely put at ease.  I've been impressed with Dara's leadership and am very optimistic about the future of the company."
244,Going through young corporation growing pains. Communication is spotty and expectations swing.,"Good pay, lots of interactions with people in the community."
245,"- Pay is decent, but not really comparable; I took a 25% pay cut for this role, however there was an equity component and some other great perks (bfast &amp; lunch at office, uber cash/month, etc.)\r\n- Less emphasis on diversity than I would like\r\n- Some people work too hard... I guess they like their jobs a lot :-) but pay isn't enough to compensate super long hours",- Exciting interesting work that is impactful\r\n- Everyone is incredibly smart and motivated and quite young\r\n- True autonomy for work\r\n- Collaborative\r\n- Very fun analytical role \r\n- Very easy access to leadership and management (they are friendly + are usually like speaking to a peer)
246,- Junior workers\r\n- Lack of processes\r\n- Unprofessional,- Stock allocation \r\n- Competitive salary
247,Management is bad\r\nHR is bad\r\nPeople are not prared for the jobs they do,"Informal\r\nPositive \r\nLack of stress\r\nFood, entertainment"
248,"Fast growth sometimes can create some lack of clarity on procedures and workflows, which can change every month.","Dynamic, challenging, fast-moving environment. \r\nVery talented and smart people all around which is great.\r\nVery high level of dedication and commitment which I have not seen anywhere else."
249,Demanding environment which can be stressful if you're not able to prioritize properly.  High need to be flexible and self driven.,Challenging environment with some of the best people I've worked with. People are ambitious and riven but in a positive cooperative manner. Uber gives you a lot of room to define how you add value in your role and is very open to new suggestions.
250,Things move extremely fast so must be agile and adaptable to keep up.,"Autonomy, there's a lot of self-management. And the work you do really can make an impact."
251,Not fully prepared to receive interns. There's no specific internship program and sometimes we end up in the limbo.,They give great opportunities to learn and grow very fast. Very generous culture of teaching and helping out.
252,"I do not see any huge cons, for me the salary system could be more visible (not sure if it depends on Uber or state), i have also heard that career paths is not so clear as on other companies (can not confirm for sure because I am working 3 months.","Great vibe in office, lot of out of job activities, fine benefits program."
253,"- everybody is in denial about the successive financial losses of Uber\r\n- departments often hate each other; lots of managers with major egos that don't allow collaboration, as it's all about them, them, them.\r\n- people leave the company very fast. This means they are unhappy, also means that all the time you have to find who to access because the person you knew left last week. All. The. Time. And it will be much worse after the IPO, when the older managers will leave\r\n- the company is shrinking in Brazil - those who still work there are ridiculously overworked. \r\n- all the secrecy. I hated that during external events, we did not identify as Uber,  but as some other company.","- good salary &amp; benefits for Brazilian standards\r\n- highly qualified &amp; capable co-workers\r\n- nice work environment: everything is modern &amp; sleek, so it makes you feel good.\r\n- San Francisco's leadership is genuinely trying to improve its relationship with employees, riders and drivers."

258,I actually don't have any cons right now.,"Autonomy! I've never worked with such autonomy as here. I am working on my personal development, both with my manager, the manager of my manager and some courses and tools using the 70, 20, 10 rule."

261,"Work-life balance is not something that you will able to get in this company (at least at this moment). Also,  special projects may come up from nowhere and take up most of your time with tons of meeting.",All the teams work really hard on all the projects and willing to walk extra miles. Always something keeps you excited.

264,Feel a bit uncertain about hte company,Nice place with good atmosphere
265,"Working with the SF HQ is something that will keep being logistically challenging - in planning phases of projects, meetings after 6pm will be common.\r\n\r\nAs we head towards IPO, we have more processes - as lightweight as they aim to be, they do add up and result in more mandatory annual trainings.\r\n\r\nAs Uber is very transparent internally, the noise levels on email, eng planning and all hands will be high: you need to learn how to efficiently filter things not currently relevant to you.","Background: I’ve worked at top tech companies in Stockholm, Berlin and London before, including Facebook.\r\n\r\nUber in Amsterdam is on the top of the range both for engineering culture/excellence and compensation. For expats like myself, the 30% tax ruling and no capital gains tax make compensation especially attractive - especially as Uber grants meaningful stock on top of strong base salary &amp; bonus as part of the package, unlike many EU startups.\r\n\r\nBut while comp might be something to get people in the door, it’s the tech culture that makes me stay and love working here every day. In Amsterdam, we own and solve global problems from building distributed systems with four 9’s of reliability to architecting scaleable systems that can support new lines of businesses like Freight and JUMP, on top Rides, Driver and Eats.\r\n\r\nCode ownership here is strong, code quality high - from required and high quality reviews to automated tests, dedicated teams building advanced tooling for all parts of the development process. Planning and architecture is a focus point and democratic: anyone can suggest new initiatives, but these need to be written down clearly and send out to (pretty much) the whole eng org. This means there’s a firehouse of information on what’s going on and even for experienced people like myself, I found my learning accelerate, seeing how other engineers attacked problems.\r\n\r\nFinally, the reason I enjoy working at Uber over other top places like Facebook is autonomy and impact. Similar to FB, autonomy of teams and individuals is very high. However, unlike FB, the impact per engineer is consistently very high across projects - chances are you will single handedly architect, build and roll out features used by millions, with large financial impact.\r\n\r\nThere are various teams in Amsterdam, internal mobility also being good and it’s easy to move between teams."
266,"Lack of respect from senior members of staff \r\n\r\nLack of respect for the Uber drivers &amp; UberEATS drivers \r\n\r\nThe pay for PSR's &amp; people on external contracts\r\n\r\nThe treatment for people on external contracts, who may work full time, doing exactly the same job as an internal employee,  but on a zero hour contract, with no entitlements to same privileges i.e. Christmas party, team night out, holiday allowances etc\r\n\r\nHow disposable staff were, and absolutely no empathy for firing 40 people on the spot, with no warning as there was no longer a need for them (this was through the onboarding process hiring drivers etc)","It was great for free food,  a well stocked pantry and cool office space!"
267,"I had 5 different managers in the 2.5 yrs I was here. My last manager was the most toxic person I've ever encountered in my entire life. We were constantly encouraged to speak up against bully management and when I did, I was shown the door. This individual was not respectful of my mental health conditions and was downright insulting on a regular basis. I actually had started up a lawsuit against him and was told that my proof of his conduct wasn't admissible in court, which does not negate his guilt. After leaving I learned that he continued to bully his subordinates without consequence and was also rated the worst manager in IT just after he was promoted after being on the team for only 6 months. I was turned down for promotion multiple times due to the fact that I never had a manager who paid attention or cared about what I was doing. If my work didn't put this person on a stage, it wasn't important to him. He became buddies with the HR rep and that's when he made it all about me and said that I was the problem. I stood up against blatant disrespect and abuse and I was forced out. This culture hasn't changed, it's reality is just shoved under the rug.",My co-workers were awesome.
268,"There's so much effort into company culture and development that it might feel like too much, if you're not used to it. It can be overwhelming.  Also, you can see how  the stereotypical startup culture clashes with attempts to be a best-practices place to work. (everybody is tired and overworked all of the time, and proud of it). It seems to be a a learning process for the company itself.","Very detailed recruiting and onboarding processes. A LOT of information at your disposal in terms of the company, career development, cultural norms, , any and all concerns you might have. Everybody is friendly and approachable.  Encouraging environment, plenty of resources to grow and learn.  Everybody is treated like a grown-up."
269,"We work very hard on problems that have never existed before, so the environment is ambiguous and there is no hand holding as everyone is working at lightning speed. People that want stability or micromanagement will not find the job they need. English is a strong requirement, so a lot of candidates can't make the process.","A dynamic, young, data-driven company that is constantly challenging you to think in different ways and you see the real impact of your work. The team is amazing and everyone brings their honest version of themselves to work as we value diversity. I have learned much more during this time than what other people learn at the same time in other companies because my level of autonomy and responsibility is very high. Fun to come to work."

290,There is very poor communication in all forms. People that have been with this company for a long period of time have very poor work ethic and will do the bare minimum to get by. It seems like the company cares the same amount about those going above and beyond and those who are outright disrespectful in their outputs. If team leads were given more authority to make decisions and impose sanctions for poor behavior I think there would be immense changes for the better.,Uber is making constant changes and there are plenty of opportunities for upward mobility. The benefits are undeniable and are what keeps people satisfied with their position. Hoping there won't be many changes to these in the future.

Amazing, talented people.\r\nEmployees have space and support to form the future shape of the company."
469,In the beginning you can not miss any days of training other wise your attendance recorder takes a big hit. Not a lot of free Uber swag.,"No micromanagement, everyone is welcoming, superiors want you to succeed, great benefits, and room for growth."

500,"Uber is a large company that hasn't yet figured out some of its processes.

You gotta be friends with someone to get a promotion usually, in other cases they expect Uber to be your only one true passion to get promoted at all, doesn't matter if you're well qualified.  Passion &gt; Skills. I was told by management that if I'm not willing to give up family time I am not ready for a promotion, although I've been recognized countless times for my good work and contributions.","Benefits are spectacular and begin day one. Uber credits monthly save a lot of money on transportation and food. Catered lunch every day, free snacks, drinks, coffee, cold brew. Ping pong and pool tables, video games, board games in break room. Management can be very friendly and helpful. Pretty good pay for entry level.  Good people.

527,"The culture is very open and casual which is not a bad thing. As a matter of fact, a lot of people see this as a plus. However, this might be a surprise or seen as a lack of professionalism at first for those who join the company from non-tech companies.","The company truly celebrates differences! I love working with such a diverse group of people whose ideas are valued regardless of their backgrounds. \r\nI feel that the company trusts employees and gives autonomy, and this motivates me to do my best. \r\nWork-life balance is great, people are competent, work we do is interesting and meaningful, and there are tons of career opportunities within.

542,"The best analogy here is like a 14 year old that looks like a 20 year old... Uber is still a young company and I think I expected more things to be in place that are just not yet. Now that I am here and doing the work, I see it differently, but I think that we're still young, we're growing fast, and we need to provide the feedback while also being patient to thoughtfully get the right systems and procedures in place.","I have truly loved my experience thus far working at Uber. I was hesitant to join because of the news, so through my interview process I was very honest, asked lots of questions, and had a 2 hour conversation with my hiring manager before accepting my offer.

556,Integrating processes is challenging in a company this big and operating in so many different markets.,"Fast growth, international company with very talented people."
557,"The ship has turned. The strength of Uber was in its decentralized nature of operating. Empowering teams\nOn the ground to make a difference and adapt to fast changing markets locally without waiting for someone in HQ to make a call. \n\nNow, especially in marketing. It’s full of folks trying to stroke their ego by centralizing the stupidest of things. \n\nI mean literally there are teams who do busy work of making decks that look pretty all day.

The culture is fast-paced but with unique challenges that come with Uber's scale (even if something affects 1% of trips, that's a lot of trips and so on). On top of that, they aim to keep a structured approach to work-life balance and professional development. \r\n\r\nAs to the recruiting experience: it was definitely the most intellectually challenging processes I've been through. A key factor was that every interviewer was actually glad to make the interview and kept a humble demeanor, which shows you the values the company wants everyone to keep."

571,"Uber has long had an identify crisis whether it is a large start-up or medium-sized corporation. With this, many of the controls and infrastructure needed for a company of this size don't exist still.  Also, given the space, priorities shift quickly. The hottest problem last half could be totally defunded the next, which can be frustrating.","Insanely smart people, massive problem space growing by the day, and plenty of career growth opportunities. Still a fairly horizontal structure, but depends on organization. New leadership heading company in the right direction and ushering us into being a company versus a start-up."

578,"In March 2018, Uber sold its southeast Asia business to Grab and exited the market in this part of the world.","Uber 2.0 (under Dhara) is a very different company compared to Uber 1.0 (under Travis).

583,"Although having a relaxed office can fantastic, sometimes it's a little too much, and it feels like more of a social hangout than a proper work environment.","Get to work with so many amazing people and make great friends. The young nature of the company means that there is a huge amount of change happening every day, and it's an great feeling to see a project that you worked on get launched in just a few short months and get rolled out to the rest of the world. The receptiveness of new ideas is a huge pro, as it allows Uber and Uber Eats to continuously evolve and streamline it's processes."
584,"Pay could definitely be increased, more positions that pertain to the need of the job itself. Sending out lines of business out the department","It was start up company. Learned a lot just starting in my career path. Definitely their were some issues management, but I would recommend to anyone fresh out of college or still attending. Great benefits, chill environment. No micromanage. Free lunch and snacks. Always providing new trainings for new products launching.  Provide scheduling for all 3 shifts with pay increase"
585,As company grew they started hiring cogs that would just fit into what they need and do things the way management would do it. They stopped celebrating diversity of experience. This cookie cutter model should be good for an IPO but will not be great for long-term success.,"Great benefits and workplace environment. Free breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Unlimited PTO is awesome."

588,"- It can get very technical and  decisions need to be made fast, which can be daunting at first","- Thorough interview process allows you to meet the team and understand the role better before you land the job \r\n- If you are used to being in a fast-paced environment, be prepared to be in an even faster-paced one, with a lot to learn (conceptual and technical) as you go along"

594,Some teams can be not that good\nPress hates us whatever we do,Awesome impact on the urban lifestyle
595,Decentralized/localized management works better; too much power on the HQ or Regional side is making Uber more bureaucratic than ever. Also does not move faster than other competitors to hit the right pain point at each locale.,"Smart people, good benefits, working culture in Asia is awesome"
596,"- The company is so huge that learning to be diplomatic when working with other teams is a necessity. Sometimes the people you have to work with will not want to help you but you have to find a way to deliver anyway.\r\n- There was a period in 2017 when the company was in a deep cultural crisis. That was a weird time and things are very different now than they were pre-crisis. Uber is a little more grown up, but a little less fun than it used to be.\r\n- Some co-workers other teams have told me their work life balance is less than ideal.",- I have learned an enormous amount about both software engineering and how to be effective in an organization the size of Uber.\r\n- Uber seems to really be making an effort to do right by its various stakeholders in the wake of several controversies surrounding the company in 2017.\r\n- Excellent opportunities for career growth.

604,"Work-life balance can be tricky, but that's something you're able to set for yourself","I joined about a year ago and have loved it. Dara, the people, the benefits, career growth."
605,"Senior management is still old school. In my personal experience, they value big shiny things over everything else. The way to get them to notice you is by making noise and fuzz and not a constant good work.",Uber is full of passionate and super smart people. Everyone believes in the company's mission and works hard to get it done. \r\nUber has taken great steps to improve the company's culture. Offices are full of amenities and they foster multiple activities to encourage diversity and inclusion of people and ideas.
606,"Difficult to terminate low-level personnel for performance, attendance or behavior\r\nMeaningful employee development is improving but historically has been lacking\r\nTough to advance from \","Working for an innovative, globally recognized company \r\nBehind the scenes insight into company that touches many daily lives\r\nWorking in support allows meaningful opportunities to help others\r\nStable job with good benefits including monthly Uber credit"

You'll find a lack of basic class, respect and courtesy in many groups.\r\n- Political players rising up faster than competent folks who gave sweat and blood to build and grow Uber to what it is today\r\n- Work-life balance not that good\r\n- Comp relatively lower compared to other options on the market. Process not objective and transparent.\r\n- Big company vibe growing. Energy and positive vibe of pre-media storm TK days no longer present. Old timers leaving in high numbers. Dara is a seasoned leader who will try to do the right thing but he is not a tech visionary/disruptor like TK. Expect to see more \","- Amazing product that has tangible positive impact on societies world wide. Legitimate alternative to car ownership.\r\n- Smart coworkers\r\n- Tough problems to solve\r\n- Future equity upside\r\n- Terrific pace of work and decision-making. Once you get used to the pace, you may find other companies boring."

610,Management needs to be more tenured. Pretty underexperienced,Great pace of work. Awesome coworkers. Mid tier pay
611,"Absolutely toxic environment, upper management pitting managers against each other, disorganized yet over managed teams, no clear path to grow as an employee, new head of software too focused on details, constant reorganization.\r\n\r\nThis is a very bad place to work.","Good pay, free lunches, whatever equipment you want for your development environment, a chance to make self-driving cars, many good employees."
612,Not much.. So many good things to say,"love this place, the people, and the energy.  Come here to work.  Hard work is rewarded. Management is open to ideas"

615,"Career pathing is pretty nebulous, and there's not a clearly defined path forward for people working in remote markets. The brunt of the opportunities tend to be in the regional hubs like DC, San Francisco or Amsterdam. There's a huge amount of scope for professional growth and learning, but it doesn't always come with a new title and a pat on the back.\r\n\r\nThe flip-side of having a lot of independence, is that there's a certainly level of ambiguity to working at Uber. Employees are given a huge amount of autonomy and are encouraged to take initiative, be thought leaders and move the business forward. It can be a hard adjustment for people who are used to working in a more structured environment.","Fast paced, innovative, and somewhere you can make a real business impact. Employees are given an enormous amount of responsibility commensurate to their overall experience, and are trusted and encouraged to be autonomous, creative and impactful. \r\n\r\nFor all the well-publicized problems the company has had, we're moving steadily and consistently in the right direction, and the New York office at least is a happy, positive and inclusive place to work."
616,"Still in startup mode, yearly changes in perf processes and career development","Flexibility, lot of responsibilities, cool and fun environment, assurance maladie paid."
617,"Some of the old uber is returning unchecked.   In particular the bad managers are now rising up after hiding and there are stories of intimidation and fear to control people.   Today I heard a manager telling very new and junior staff while talking about money and stock at their work area, that uber only knows about them what he tells them,  so if they want a pay rise, stock anything they should look after him (in a very not so joking way).  Please don't let the old uber return, the new uber is a much nicer place to work.",Its a company that wants to do the right thing.   You work on a product that is important to so many people in a very real way.  It has a great mission that can change the world.

620,"Lack of some developer productivity infrastructure - I've been wanting a virtual machine with a static IP for a while and I can't get it yet. But they are aware, acknowledge the issue and are fixing it.","Over the last 3 months, I've seen and met a lot of engineers, product managers and others who are really smart, engaged and focused on providing the best possible quality (and I mean literally - we've had jams over how a certain animation impacts our users understanding of the product and the business impact). Things like ownership are fairly clear, people move fast and you really feel like you are delivering something valuable."

People like to get together in order to solve problems, help one another with the projects.\r\nIt's a place where you can grow up professionally involving yourself in a lot of different projects.\r\nA company focused on the future of cities."
630,"Sometimes people here expects too much from everyone, so the work/life balance needs some attention.","Uber gives a lot opportunities for growing professionally and inside the company, and working for a market like Brazil makes it even better, as we have a lot of challenges in the country and the company will help us to overcome it."
631,"We need some work on process, but we are working on it.","It is a great place to get your career started! We are still considered a start-up company and with that, comes the opportunity to make a difference. All the managers truly care about career development and there is overall a sense of family within the tech recruiting org. We are all treated like adults here and managers don't care about the little things like what time you get in the office etc. as long as you get your work done.  Amazing company to work for!"

I've really enjoyed my experience at Uber as a Product Manager and had the opportunity to work face to face with Travis often. He was a true visionary and inspired those around him with a calm demeanor and fair management.

Relatively little red tape in starting a project once you have validated that it will be useful and provide value to fellow engineers or users.\r\n* Much improved work life balance from what I hear it was like in 2015 and 2016.

Our new CEO, Dara, has implemented many positive changes and under this leadership we will continue to grow, improve, and thrive!","Uber offers ahmaaaaazing benefits to employees.  On top of that, my work is personally fulfilling.  I am given autonomy and creative authority over my work.  I enjoy the culture here that celebrates differences and encourages you to shine by sharing ideas even if they start off utterly ridiculous or seem out of reach.  I work alongside some of the most brilliant people you'll ever meet.  What a treat!  I have a voice here and the best part about it is that my voice is heard!"
683,"On the con side of the tech debt problem I alluded to before, there are parts of the engineering process that are painful at times.  We've been committing resources to fix it, but there's still a lot of room to improve.\r\n\r\nDifferent parts of the organization still feel oceans apart.  Maps reminds me a lot of Google, other parts of the company feel like other organizations entirely.  We still have a ways to go towards homogenizing our values and standards, but things are improving.  Just be mindful of which team you end up on if you decide to join.  that said, transferring is easy and encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe media attention can be draining.  The world can't seem to stop talking about Uber.  In some ways it feels motivating to be working when all eyes are pointed your way, but it can also be painful to be put under such intense scrutiny.","I've worked for a number of great companies over the years: Google, the games industry, research labs.  I can with confidence that Uber is the best place I've ever worked.\r\n\r\nThe challenges are fascinating.  We're not just building a website or driving ad clicks.  We're attempting to fundamentally change the way people and things are transported around the globe.\r\n\r\nThe impact is tangible.  At a place like Google, it's easy for an engineer to feel lost in the weeds.  Uber has become a big company, but every project still feels vital.  Every engineer has the chance to affect millions of riders and driver partners.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities are abundant.  Uber has grown faster than any startup in history, but that growth meant there wasn't always time to build to scale.  That's both a positive and a negative at times, but on the plus side, it means there are many parts of our tech stack that can be optimized and improved by a motivated engineer.  If you want to take ownership or a project you feel passionate about, no one is going to get in your way.\r\n\r\nChange is happening.  2017 was a real wake up call for Uber.  Thankfully, the company took note and listened.  We're now refocusing on the longterm sustainability of growth and talent.  I've seen so much positive change happen in just over a year.  It's been a roller coaster of emotions at times, but it always trends upwards."
684,Management still not transparent. No manager training being performed. HR function too weak. More effort needed for employees to feel valued.,Company has been making a lot effort in terms of employee management. Salary and Benefits have been improved over the last 1year
685,"stagnant, low pay, boring and repetitive.","Free snacks, über credits, lax"
686,Put more effective to company,l love the company
687,"Terrible pay, progression opportunities are limited by favouritism and/or Global policies","Intelligent peers, good social culture, friendly office, no severe hierarchy present"
688,Lack of defined paths to advancement,Catered lunches. Management is accessible.
689,"There could be more work/balance and sometimes we change the strategy too fast, so it is necessary a lot of flexibility from the employees to adapt.","Imagine yourself working surrounded by high level professionals, where anyone can give and idea and change things on a short period.\r\nWe do work a lot, but it is a really nice job!"
690,"- Not the company fault  but some employees haven't understood that this is still a company and they abuse it like IBM or something\r\n- They are evolving, which is not wrong but just painful to people who don't like change.","- Super Busy, Super Productive, Super Motivating\r\n- You can actually change life of people not just add a filter to a selfie.\r\n- Proud of working for a company with big bold bets"
691,"Most employees are much more competitive than collaborative (at least in Brazil, where I work)\r\nMost leaders are still white males\r\nPeople outside the company don't see it as cool as it really is","Good energy and ambiance;\r\nFocus on results, not methods;\r\nTrue push for \"
692,Not to much support and payment is done through a third party,Team oriented fun environment  relax work place
693,Don't really agree with Uber Eats and how much waste the business produced,"Smart people, fast paced environment"
694,"Career progression,  no clear structure","Free food, free transpo, apple computer"
695,11 hour shifts are tough,"Free food, great career progression opportunities and positive office environment."
696,Demanding tasks and learning on the job.,Challenging and Supporting culture that makes you excel in your professional careers. Many benefits and easy to switch among different roles
697,Culture is geared towards drinking and there is so much tension between the sexes. News articles you read are true--it's a frat boy playground where white guys in hoodies rule. Women have less opportunity to advance because they are often told that they are \,"Good health benefits, free lunches, great name to have on your resume, and a casual dress code."
698,Too many politics and bad compensation,Superpumped and opportunity to set up a system from scratch
699,"-It's a big company, so some of the same slow downs of working between teams happens, but it's not as bad as other bigger ones.\r\n-The food isn't as good as competitors, the management doesn't think this is serious but a lot of people care about what they put in their body every day (nutrition and quality)\r\n-The program/platform breakdown can cause issues where some program teams don't allocate time for tech debt and engineering excellence.\r\n-The alignment between product/design/eng could be much better (work in progress)\r\n-No dedicated on-call program where the volunteers make extra $ and not everyone has to contribute. This is what the other big players do and is a more mature way of operating.",-Really strong engineering practices and opportunities to learn\r\n-Brilliant and friendly people\r\n-Real world impactful work\r\n-The company has a real drive to change for the better culturally\r\n-A lot of opportunities for autonomy and personal initiatives\r\n-Faster moving than other big companies.
700,"The training process is not where it should be and nearly everyone seems to have a bumpy ride on their way to getting the hang of things, which can be daunting. Also, because you are often the third point of contact for Drivers...many people need to be shown a lot of empathy and understanding, along with being told \",Meeting people from all over the world and helping them is an amazing opportunity. Being the only point of contact that is in-person often means you are also the \
701,Uber fully empowers their employees to take vacations and time to recharge but work can get pretty intense.,Uber has outstanding  learning and growth opportunities.  Employees are fully empowered to challenge the status quo and build an amazing business from the ground up. Has a great culture  with young and talented people that will challenge you to become better everyday.
702,"- it's a bloody lot of work: if you love to take things on cruise control this is not the place for you. It's definitely not a 9-5 type environment (and I hope it never becomes that!) \r\n- public scrutiny: you need to be thick skinned as not everyone will love Uber as much as you might. Whether it's an unhappy driver partner that you need to win back over, or a know it all relative at Christmas lunch, you will find yourself talking about Uber 24/7 (and often defending/explaining the company). It can be draining and you need to be ready for that. \r\n- crazy amount of change: personally, I love the pace of change, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you like routine and hate ambiguity and seemingly endless changes this is not the place for you. If you are happy to roll with the punches and make the most of every situation, then you will do just fine.","I could list the pros all day, but here is a select few: \r\n- awesome team: 95%+ of the people I work with at Uber are amazing and people, who I consider friends, not just colleagues \r\n- you can be yourself: want to wear shorts and thongs to work? this is the place for you! In my experience you can be your authentic self (whatever that may be!) \r\n- treated really well: despite what you might read in the press, Uber is not an evil company trying to take over the world. At all levels of the company I have found that everyone treats each other with respect and values their ideas and opinions. Sure there are a few bad apples, but the great people far outweigh them!"
703,Well cons.. I think it has more to do with the past of Uber as a company. It used to be a company with a really bad brand image and is always in headlines for making really big mistakes. But today I can say that my last six months we've been working so hard to make things better for our customers and we will be the company everyone used to love,"What I love about Uber is that there is a spot for everyone. There is a wide range of job of opportunities and within a certain role you can always speak your mind and try out new things. It is my first job and I am so excited about it because here they have taught me incredible things about working in teams, sharing initiatives with other countries and traveling to meet new people, like A LOT. Your mind opens in ways you can't actually imagine and you are always thinking of new ideas and how to improve. And most importantly you can speak up to your beliefs always. Also there is always something new going on, it NEVER gets boring at all. It is a fast changing company very committed to make cities a better place for their people and their families"
704,-Pay is below average for big companies\r\n-Politics sometimes get in the way (although a lot less than other companies I have worked for),-Great Flexibility\r\n-A lot of independence\r\n-Tons of responsibility\r\n-The company values difference\r\n-You can be yourself\r\n-It's a company of best ideas\r\n-Flexible dress code
705,- Some processes are not as well defined as mature companies. But the company is working hard to close the gaps soon,- Amazing challenges: company still have A LOT of room for growth and development of cool stuff\r\n- Quality and caliber of coworkers\r\n- Culture - very cooperative and inclusive
706,"Workload is large, business never stops","Excellent culture, environment, and focus on people"
707,The company is getting too big. More people = more bureaucracy = slower innovation.,"Uber gives you the opportunity to work with the brightest minds around, and allows you to get hands-on on solving the problems that impact the way our cities and communities are built."
708,"No cons at all, just the best place to work I had experienced so far. Definitely has none cons I had identified.","Career growth, benefits, flexibility and challenges. The work culture help you to learn a lot and to encourage you to develop your skills and personal objectives."
709,Very few processes since it is a startup but it gives you a lot of flexibility to explore and experiment by yourself.,"You will work with smart and nice team players and you will feel challenged with problems to be solved every day. The compensation is super competitive and it goes beyond cash. At Uber you will definitely feel that you are an owner of Uber because you actually will be.\r\n\r\nTons of opportunities to grow and if you are a rockstar, you will be promoted quickly or moved to other countries if you want.\r\n\r\nThis is the most aligned company globally I have ever been. You can have access to presentations with top executives and you will feel the vision every day with lots of transparency from the top down and across the company."
710,- Latam Region is growing and we have a interesting workload \r\n- Everything moves so fast you'll need to adapt fast to survive,"- Uber is a great place to learn and apply your knowledge\r\n- Very diverse team, you can meet people from all around the world! \r\n- You'll see the impact of your work almost immediately"
711,There's not a solid continuous learning program,"Perks are really good, there is a lot of room for new ideas, you get to work with cutting edge technologies, people is very open to change and things move really fast"
712,Senior management is generally not seasoned enough to manage a company of such scale. Strategies change constantly.,Very smart people. You have a lot of autonomy to make decisions that will change the course of the company.
713,- Onboarding could have been much better \r\n- Work-life balance,- Huge impact on direct customers and cities\r\n- Freedom of innovation and decision making \r\n- Exponential growth \r\n- Uber perks
714,"- lots of process gaps\n- may need to hustle at times, need to resolve a crisis ASAP sometimes\n- changes are sometimes implemented from the HQ without advance notice to the regional offices\n- depending on your own values, you may not like the startup culture","- good autonomy at work; you plan your own work provided you can show results\n- good team spirit\n- free lunches to build team morale by eating together\n- people are professional and cooperate together to make something work\n- good benefits including leave, medical insurance etc"
715,"Given that Uber has more than doble month by month for a long period, there are some internal process that needs to be fixed.","First, Uber still have some trait of start ups: city teams have independence to propose ideas to their own city, you have access to all the information you need (with a very hard privacy policy) and people are always looking for improvements. Second, before joining Uber I heard many bad aspects of the culture in place, but things has change dramatically since mid 2017. Now there is a super bright and high performing team with a very pleasant and collaborative work environment."
716,"Work is potentially 24/7. Anyone who is happy and fulfilled at Uber has in her/him an inner self-propulsor,  and he/she is comfortable with accepting, as a tradeoff, that less time is left for personal life.","Ownership: Uber is a place where you are always expected to deliver on vision, execution and iterative innovation - and you're expected to be driven by the inner fire that is purpose. \r\nImpact: Your decisions drive the business, and the business touches millions of people every single day in very real, very tangible ways. This is a unique motivator for anyone who cannot stomach work as \"
717,"Work is intense and ever changing, the speed is quick and there is a very strong bias for execution.","At Uber you have an amazing opportunity to have substancial real world impact through technology that drives self-employment, business empowerment for restaurants and actually provide time back to people who use our platforms."
718,"The company is actively improving work/life balance and compensation, but these are two areas could be cons: \r\n\r\n- Work/life balance can be a struggle at times, due to the fast-paced work environment\r\n- The company is still working to make compensation competitive to the market","I have worked at Uber for 3 years, two years in the US and one year in Latin America.  Working for Uber in Latin America is an amazing experience to grow professionally and personally. Some pros:\r\n\r\n- Fast-paced environment with a ton of ownership\r\n- Ability to make an impact from day 1\r\n- Energized teams and talented coworkers that make me excited to come to work every day\r\n- Career opportunities and professional development are great as the business is expanding rapidly"
719,- Still figuring out HR: trying to implement big company policies with the impact of coming down as an iron curtain sometimes\r\n- Pay is considered too low and the 'excitement of your role' is treated as a financial benefit\r\n- As a relatively young company with a very flat organizational structure people considering working for Uber should be comfortable knowing they'll need to carve out their own career path,"- Autonomous\r\n- Get to work on problems that are moving the dial - we're aiming for 10% improvements, not 0.1% improvements\r\n- Highly motivated peers that drive you to be your best\r\n- High pressure workplace that allows you to better understand yourself and what drives you"
720,"High level of stress / pressure to deliver results. \r\nAlthough there are many (good) intentions and processes to reduce it, business always ends being the most important piece, and work/life balance is not in fact always as great as we believe it is / as HR wants it to be.","I feel like there is fairness when it comes to career opportunities. I'm impressed by the number of people that I've seen growing in less than 2 years time. Also, I love the fact that everybody is very involved while being autonomous at work. Empowerement is great at Uber and was never seen before anywhere else."
721,"As one of the fastest growing companies in the world, Uber has no schedules and the pressure to excel at your job can be a little overwhelming at times.","Uber is a place where you can truly be yourself, you have the freedom to explore, excel at your job and you work with the best and smartest people around you."
722,"Wear and tear on your vehicle. Possible creeps in your car, rude customers sometimes. The complexity of insuring yourself properly can be frustrating.",Lucrative if you're in a city with a lot of highways and no traffic. You can meet a lot of cool people from all walks of life.
723,"There's a lot of work to be done, which sometimes can mean long hours.  Management is generally good about encouraging balance and time off","You work with motivated, smart, and fun people on a daily basis, which leads to one of the best cultures at Uber\r\nThe leaders of the LatAm org are incredible, and focus on building fellow leaders\r\nThe work matters, and you're given the chance to have an impact from Day 1\r\nThe cafeteria serves a great breakfast and lunch as well as a coffee bar all day\r\nEveryone, including junior team members, are given the freedom to build - bureaucracy is avoided whenever possible\r\nUnlimited vacation"
724,in some countries in LATAM we are not regulated so is is not so easy to work,"networking, too many opportunities to growth within the company"
725,The fast pace and passion cause us to focus on too many things rather than fewer more impactful ones.,"I so excited about what we are doing at Uber, really having the opportunity to design the strategy of the fastest moving company of all times and then being in charge of implement it. All this with extremely talented folks and the greatest work environment."

728,"- Work/life balance: you will work a lot. Most of Uber employees are hard working and are not forced to stay at the office ( at the contrary, management will push you to respect your work life balance), but you will definitely work a lot.\r\n- Salary/Benefits if you compare to other sectors where you could probably be working (bank/M&amp;A/consultant) and paid much more.\r\n- Vertical moves and promotions might be difficult depending on your area . Being a top performer at Uber is extremely difficult","- People are amazing. You'll be working with pure incredibly smart people with extremely good values. \r\n- Feedback oriented company: feedback culture is part of Uber's DNA and this helps a lot for you to grow and improve your skills every day\r\n- Internal tools are amazing\r\n- You'll love the work environment and impact of all the things you do. You'll be much more passionate in the projects you lead in Uber than having your own company\r\n- International company where it's easy to interact at global level\r\n- Mobility: HRs policies extremely good to move internally to other cities/country\r\n- Amazing office, free food, etc"

733,Work life balance might not be the best out there,"You have a real impact in projects and can see how they reflect in the company's overall goal to provide safe, reliable transportation in our communities.\r\nYou are part of a company with some of the smartest people out there.\r\nWe are data driven, but always do the right thing.\r\nThere are a lot of growth possibilities for you as an employee."

739,Getting more bureaucratic as it grows,"High degree of ownership and responsibility, steep learning curve, fun and smart colleagues"
740,"This is not a 9 to 5 place. If you are looking for that type of job, Uber is not the place for you. In addition, career planning is still a WIP an whether opportunities open each day, for those looking for more certainty and structure about their growth it could be challenging","At Uber I get to work every day with people incredibly talented and passionate about what they do. There is a profound drive for the mission at hand that get's you going, even for long hours, but without ever feeling bored or having any regrets. We move faster in a month than most of the previous companies I worked for do in a whole year!"

The culture is still very toxic.,Lots of exciting problems to work on and solve. Most roles are given a lot of autonomy. Uber (and therefore your work) is very visible.

Projects still have massive impact, but we are starting to have a lot more people contribute to something that one person used to do (which is a good thing for quality &amp; work life balance for sure).","Teams are small and insanely impactful. Engineers deploy code to systems with &gt;10K QPS daily, run experiments on hundreds of thousands or millions of users and work on projects with millions of dollars of impact or savings.\r\n\r\nWe get to work (super) close with data science product and design and have a real say in decisions made.\r\n\r\nColleagues are nice and friendly. Compensation is exceptionally good for Amsterdam and the job has many small perks (health budget that can be spent on e.g. Apple Watch, 300EUR/month Uber credits, team outings etc). Good portion of equity, with a 2019 IPO looking quite likely, with our new CEO.\r\n\r\nOverall, easily one of the best places to work for in Europe. Places that compare are Facebook London and Google Zurich. The office is a lot smaller than Facebook or Google though, meaning a lot more opportunities to make a major impact in Amsterdam."

If you are passionate about cities, transportation, and changing the way people move, this is the place for you. No matter your role, if you have a great idea, the company will support it. Amazing group of people. Work is also flexible with alternatives to work remotely."

With the size of the company some startup practice is simply not effective anymore, need to get over this stage.","result-oriented, no-nonsense flat structure, more like a startup -- still a big startup.  The executives communicate to employees timely and effectively, laying out visions in a concise, right-at-the-point fashion,  Uberversity is a great way to share knowledge and learn, and it encourages people to be spontaneous to do work, you can do as much as you like, just like a startup.  The working environment is also engineer oriented, flat management structure, flexible work schedules, etc."
766,"As with most tech companies, change is very fast and communication could use improvement. Compensation is lower than many high tech firms, but good benefits.","Friendly, smart people interested in making great products for our internal and external customers. Office is diverse as compared to most Pittsburgh tech companies and is very welcoming."

Uber also allow you to work in another city or country you choose after 6 months working in the city you got hired for (but of course it is based on the result of several tests and job availabilities)."

I came from a similar company and had a wealth of experience before joining Uber.  I am blown away by the technology and resources available to make my work more efficient, and to change the way the marketplace operates on a day to day basis. \r\n\r\nI started about three months ago and the welcome experience has been tremendous.  Training on internal resources and the company was significant. Team members in my group and employees at large are super friendly and highly intelligent.  \r\n\r\nIf you are looking to be the smartest person in the room, or a big fish in a little pond, you might want to keep looking.  The talent here is obvious and spectacular."
772,"Lack of communication inside the company is still a problem and I don't see it getting fixed any time soon. I do feel a lot of times, decision making is pretty much top-down. Onboarding experience needs to be improved a lot. Product goals are not well aligned between different orgs. Overall, I don't feel that a lot of folks care very much about others and what they do.\r\n\r\nUpper management is still being stabilized. Some folks who joined 3-4 years ago are leaving, but this situation is understandable and common in startups at this stage.","The company still has a lot of potential in terms of business growth. Compensation package for new hires is competitive. Some projects are truly interesting. A lot of things are being fixed. Overall, things are probably better than most other startups in similar stage."

Also, as we're still growing, sometimes that means working longer. But with the new management we're in a great path!","Uber is challenging and thrilling in every possible way! Your ideas area valued, your job has direct impact, you get to work in a multicultural environment with super smart, passionate and cool people, you have lots of exposure and global career opportunities."
781,"It used to be great two years ago. Now, with re-org, getting business more scalable, it became corporation. For some people it might be good.

785,At present growth opportunities (for positions beyond Sr. Engineer) seem limited as opposed to SF.,"Tldr; It's amazing. Apply now.\r\n\r\nWhy Uber:\r\n- There are just a few tech companies, where you work on problems of such scale (petabytes of data, 50k+ QPS etc).  \r\n- There are even fewer companies where you solve problems in the real world, ie. you're not helping people share cat memes, you're providing millions of partners from hundreds of countries, a livelihood.\r\n\r\nWhy Uber in Amsterdam:\r\n- Impactful work: This isn't just another satellite campus. Uber Engineering in Amsterdam works on problems, that are essential for business.\r\n- Work/life balance: Maybe this applies to more places in Europe in general, but you're encouraged to pace things in a way you're comfortable.\r\n- Phenomenal compensation: almost 50-100% more than competing firms in Amsterdam, while this might be less absolute money than offers in SF or London, the cheaper cost of living in Amsterdam ensures you have a very comfortable life.\r\n- Great Benefits: Apart from regular things like insurance, and gym membership, you also get about ~300 EUR of Uber credits a month, you can use them on rides or to order food from Uber Eats, you can basically get away with never cooking dinner.\r\n\r\nWhy Amsterdam:\r\n- Beautiful city, amazingly located especially if you want to strike off over a dozen travel locations from your bucket list. \r\n- Everyone knows English and is very friendly towards expats!\r\n- Theres a tax benefit for High Knowledge immigrants in the Netherlands, that'll bring down your effective tax rate to about 25% (from 50+%.)"

I really identify with the cultural, with the company norms and I have learnt more than I have learnt in any other company! It's been an amazing rise and I look forward to what is to come."
792,-Poor balance between personal and professional life.  It has been quite stressing but leaders are actually working on fixing this \r\n-Some managers are young so we still need to improve trainings for them\r\n-I started as EXT and they changed some tenure rules which caused pressure and conflict among my team - which hasn't been solved as we've expected,"-You get to create processes, how things are gonna work from now on\r\n-The people, we all make the best work environment \r\n- Great organizational culture - specially since we're improving it; there's no hierarchy levels cause your voice is always heard no matter what level you're speaking to or are, flexible working hours (depending on the role of course) and I actually feel it's a company that cares for its employees\r\n-There's a lot of career opportunities - specially since we keep growing globally\r\n-Promotions  are according to your performance and skills, not only due to seniority at the company"
793,"- The fast growth was also a bit painful. Constant changes, switch of priorities every time and we didn't really got to plan anything, just react and deliver.\r\n-  Its very hard to be in a company so publicly known, where you see negative news almost every day... most of the times these are not entirely true. \r\n- As we grew so fast, we tried to grow our people very fast too. We got to a point where we had lots of young managers - that were first time managers.","- I had the opportunity to be one of the first employees in Uber in LATAM. It's been amazing  to see how fast it has grown and all the potential we still have.

Before joining Uber, i had my doubts considering all the bad news in the media. However, this place is not like how they describe at all. My experience so far is amazing. I love what i do and i am very motivated. Unlike other big tech giants, what you do here matters.

847,There are still some lingering affects of the former regime. Some employees feel the baggage of the past. Ongoing Waymo suit is a drag.,I joined in October 2017 and wouldn't have joined under the former CEO.  The  current vision and leadership of the company is inspiring and it's headed in the right direction.  It feels like an exciting time to be here. Dara seems great.

We build close relationships with drivers which makes work feel like a second home. There is lots of room to grow with the company if your looking for something long-term, and theres very little to nothing that goes unnoticed."
868,"Poor pay, horribly managed environment, mistreatment by drivers, blatant sexism and favoritism, unqualified people getting promotions, and emotional exhaustion & burnout. Also, HR rarely pays attention to reports of unethical & illegal activity.","At this point, there is very little that is positive about working here apart from the health insurance, Lyra mental health coverage (which is beyond essential), and a 401k.

873,Learning is limited due to the repetitiveness of the activity,Great vibe and learning in regards to Uber as a tech company
874,"Because Uber is expanding so fast, sometimes global teams work in a disjoint manner","1. Great team culture. Everyone has a larger goal to work toward. \r\n2. You get to work with the best tools. The team internally always strives to use the best tools and techniques available to solve their problems while keeping the larger goal in the center. \r\n3. Compensation is great. Besides the money they pay you, perks like Uber credits, free food and snacks, reimbursement for gym and corporate phone - all these add to the satisfying experience of working for Uber."
875,"Because Uber is such a largely known global brand, I expected to be incentivised more for my work.","Uber has a young and vibey working environment, the team is made up of a diverse number of people and every day you learn something new."

884,Could be a bit chaotic.,Challenging - Expanding - fun
885,A lot of projects are running at the same time. I feel that sometimes the company should have more focus by prioritizing some of them.,"The points I like most are related to the autonomy that is given to employees in general. It is possible to learn about the processes, talk to really good people around the world and make a difference in the company."

887,Some people have a big Ego just because we work in a Tech Company.,A great and comfortable place to work with people that encourages you to always work harder and push forward looking for improvements and grow.
888,Sometimes feel a bit lost with all the technologies. Many teams assign us bug reports without adequate information.,My opinion is taken seriously even as a newbie. Lots of new technology. Relaxed environment. Not micromanaged. Many open source projects.
889,"Many roles still ambiguous and still relatively fast changes. 2017 has featured uptick in attrition in senior levels and pockets of company; was close to zero (voluntary) in years prior owing to valuation increase. (As you can probably read about in a news search.) Controversial in most parts of the world, and polarizing in certain circles of people and areas.","Growth opps of a startup within a maturing, highly relevant company in pop culture, tech and more broadly society."
890,"Somewhat unorganized, expectations of sales of sometimes unreasonable.",Great Hours and laid back environment. Also great pay.
891,"Too many overnight operational changes, Experts (on the frontlines) receive information on these changes too last minute with barely any explanation or instructions on how to deliver these changes. Upper management/operations unfortunately like to hide behind their computers and expect the underpaid Experts to take all the heat. Management does not care about employees, too cheap to spend on things that miiight make for a better workplace environment. Managers often talk to employees the same way they talk to drivers, making them believe what they are doing/subject to is normal.  For tri-weekly meetings, you are required to stay after work hours and are NOT PAID for 30min to 1hr gaps between working hours and meeting. There are MANY features of the operation that are marketed as beneficial to the driver however they only benefit the rider (upfront pricing). Managers are too focused on their bougie lifestyles and don't care for the people working for them. The role of an Expert is something I would not wish upon my worst enemy. Only reason I rated 2-stars is because of the benefits. They're good but not good enough to keep me in a job that will send me to the madhouse.",The health/dental/vision benefits are good. Uber credits are a plus.
892,"The reorganization.\n\nI was hired as a Test Operator and I loved the work we did. It was challenging and fun. The managers cared, listened, and respected us. We were a productive, engaged team. I was happy and, as far as I could tell, so were the rest of the test ops team. I felt like I made a difference. \n\nBut it was too good to last.... They announced a reorganization complete with all new job titles. One of the job descriptions was almost exactly the same as what we were already doing but we were told we would no longer be allowed to do this work anymore. We would need at least 6 months with Uber to apply. Our department had not been around 6 months and all but a handful of us did not meet that requirement. The good news is that this new job would come with a raise, if you were able to get it. \n\nOur new job would be VO, the job duties were significantly decreased and we lost some of our benefits. We were merged into another department and now work under their management.\n\nThe work now feels meaningless and empty. I’m unsure of the short term goal and can’t seem to get a clear picture of how the reorganization contributes to the longer term goal in any meaningful way. I’m struggling to keep motivated with the loss of direction and my role in improving the technology through this new position. \n\nOur new managers play favorites with the people they have been working with from the beginning. We’ve had no opportunity to get to know the people we work with/for. \n\nMost employers grandfather people in to their benefits/job duties when they make a decision to reorganize like this. It shows respect for the talent that you have recruited with the promise of these benefits/duties.","Great perks and benefits.\nCool technology and growing industry.\nMost co-workers are friendly.\nReally awesome job to start out.\nIn the beginning, I felt like I made a difference and helped to improve the technology and the future. \nMy job felt like it had meaning."

Every day,  I see people using our products and can experience the outcome of my team's hardwork. The freedom you're given is also amazing. If I want to travel, I can do so. If I have an idea for a project/feature/initiative, I can design and get help building it. If I want to user test my designs, they'll find people for me to do so. If I want to further my education with a class/conference/whatevee, they'll pay for it. I also have a very good sense of how to progress and grow here which is important."

911,"Low compensation, Lots of salary disputes. In terms of the job itself, the company is making us their robots. We just follow this set of policies, and punish drivers/riders who are being reported without proper investigating it. This makes the riders get more refund every ride, because we just basically believe everything they say. And also easy for drivers to fake Cleaning fee claims, which can charge riders up to 250 bucks.",Free food and no discrimination in the workplace.

919,My experience has been way better than what you hear in the news.,"Cutting edge technology, great benefits, awesome perks, great management!"
920,"It has to provide access to job training because many individuals do not know how to do their jobs. There are many folks who have been with the company for years, and classic startup, have been promoted to management roles without spending the time actually getting the necessary experience. There are many managers who are first time managers. This leads to chaos, a lack of organization and inability to take action on behalf of their teams and fix issues. Teams are over worked and under compensated. Reorgs are constant. Teams are not encouraged to work together across orgs.  Promotions are given based on friendship and how long you've been at the company, not talent, success or ability.",Uber is currently investing a lot in current employees with access to job training and employee education.

The job I was hired to do is now being pitched as a promotion to my current role, effectively meaning I and many others received a wrongful demotion. Uber is walking a thin line between immoral and illegal with this change.",Excellent Health/Dental/Vision coverage. Free meals. Unlimited PTO before it was cut. Interesting technology.
923,unclear career growth path\r\nlow incentive schemes,Scheduled trainings and meetings\r\nVery transparent management
924,"Uber's a really controversial company and while we know internally that we try to do the right thing, the world often doesn't see it that way. It can be really exhausting to constantly see your company portrayed negatively in the media. It also becomes a bit exhausting to explain the situation to your friends and family. This exhaustion can sometimes be felt at the office. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while Uber's tried quite hard to keep itself transparent, the speed at which the company moves can leave you feeling like you don't know what's happening in your own company. And at the moment, there aren't enough company-wide events that help alleviate this.","I joined Uber right after graduating form university and so far, I think it's an awesome place to start a career. I'm often surprised by the responsibility and autonomy that I have as a New Grad. I love that I always feel like I don't know enough as that's constantly pushed me to learn more things more quickly and I can definitely see how this has helped me grow faster than my friends who graduated at the same time."

Work runs more smoothly.","I receive a lot of support from my manager & some of my colleagues, the environment is becoming more & more pleasant"

I understand why COE COS/agents are expected to report to work on a public holiday, but for those who work in the COE but aren't agents/aren't handling tickets, I don't understand why it's really necessary for us to be at work (think of the money that could have been saved by letting some employees have the holidays off instead of spending it on paying employees' holiday pay, electricity, etc.). The fact that we are expected to be at work even on holidays was never explicitly communicated to me during the hiring process, either.\r\n\r\n- New employees don't seem to be properly oriented on policies, processes, etc. - the first few weeks can be quite daunting.","- Free meals and snacks\r\n- Uber credits\r\n- Really nice office\r\n- Transparency (everyone is kept in the loop on what's happening even before it reaches the media)\r\n- Huge company, meaning there are lots of opportunities for growth and you get the chance to work on various projects and meet different people"

981,Not that flexible schedule. Communication sometimes needs to be worked on,Benefits Free lunch and snacks. Great team work environment. Internal succeeding programs

Many times our workflow is interrupted by local authorities, due to the regulatory issues",Improve people’s lifestyle in the city. Modernize the way people move in the city.

986,"Horrible management, inefficient systems, trial by fire mentality. Management is out of touch with workers. Supervisor positions are based off seniority and not on 'meritocracy'. All new hires are on a trial by fire 3/4 month temp worker position causing unnecessary stress and the hiring of some people that shouldn't be there. Honestly this whole office wouldn't need to be here if Uber spent some time fixing it's funnel operations. How is it efficient to allow someone with one phone number to make over 20 accounts but only allow them to use one? Why aren't there better instructions during the sign-up process so people upload drivers licenses instead of selfies? This office is here to help fix those problems, but they don't address the root of the issue. Poor design on both the app and in how Uber as a whole is organized.","Free catered lunch, good benefits, relatively cool co-workers."
987,"Some of the people in leadership are too young and immature for their roles. They are really bright and driver, but that doesn't necessarily make them good leaders. There is a human aspect to being a leader that is lacking in some. The compensation team was never a team that thought the people were the most important aspect of the company. When negotiating salary shoot high otherwise its going to be really tough once you sign.","Over the last 4 years of my life Uber was my life. I lived and breathed the company and everything it had to offer. It was an honor to help this company grow in LatAm and work with so many smart, driven, and generally good people. Working long hours, working on the weekends, and the hustling was generally not a problem because I was constantly inspired to keep going.  Would not change my experience at Uber for any other company."
988,I feel that  anyone cares about  who you are or what happens to you. Maybe 1 person at less and that makes us know less as a team.,Nice place and people. It is a diferent work because im able to know people a round the world acrros  the computer.\r\n\r\nIt's funny because only with a computer i can help people and that is satisfying.
989,Uber has grown too explosively and there are so many people doing the same thing. Too much redundancy and too many people now.,Your work can have great impact. It is still a growing business and impacts so many lives in a positive way. Most people I have met at the company are awesome and very unlike the image that is portrayed in the media. I am sure things changed after the events of this year.

991,"Losing your seniority when converted, it's as if I started all over again. But worth it either way!",I have been working at Uber Mexico for 9 months. Started as an external then got converted to FTE. It has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life. the company really cares for its employees and I feel like I can contribute to society just by coming in to work.
992,I can't see this by now,"The values, the personal development and the proud to be here"
993,THere are none that I can think of,Best company I have ever worked for. Always asking for feed back on their performance and really care about their employee. The benefits are amazing. I feel encouraged to be myself and bring ALL of my ideas to the table.
994,Holiday season is the worst.  They take everyone off of their usual account to help with the heavy call volume.  All of the calls are BS and you are not empowered to handle anything during the phone call.   Everything that you can do the customer can do themselves on the website.,"SAG desks and teams are better because you are not getting constant calls from various company's customers,  who are angry 99% of the time.  I worked on SAG team and we basically had our own accounts and you build a rapport with the shippers in most cases."
995,I can't see anything wrong with the work place and people that I work with.,Good work place and nice people to work with
996,"Managers who are supportive, proactive, and empathetic are unfortunately the exception, not the rule. I imagine some of this stems from scope problems (most managers simply have too many direct reports; my first had something near 20), but if you talk with engineers, there are a scant few who don't have a story about how their manager really let them down during a promotion cycle, review cycle, or project in a manner that was obscurantist at best or callous at worst.\r\n\r\nTeams often try to parallelize the product development cycle. This has repeatedly been the source of a lot of stress and thrashing on important projects. Engineers will be asked to work in parallel with product and design contributors, meaning that as the product design changes, engineers will need to follow along. It's often unclear when and how a design will change, or even whether it will change again; there's just not a good communication pipeline or standardized workflow on a number of teams.\r\n\r\nIf you're an engineer, there's an immense onus placed on you to drive the success of your projects. Engineers are the last filter between a product's idea and its implementation, and so the responsibility falls on them to account for not only product edge cases, but gaps in design documentation (which is never formalized, and usually just a set of slides that requires a follow-up meeting or three to clarify), and team workflow.\r\n\r\nIn short, the culture is that if anything gets in your way, if there's any blocker you hit, if anything at all is unclear, that is YOUR sole responsibility to surmount. This creates a lot of stress, because it is at odds with being thorough in an environment where productivity and throughput are first-class engineering values.","As an engineer at Uber, you're presented with a unique opportunity to have a very high impact-to-unit-work, and to release products that go live instantly worldwide. The IC-level talent is phenomenal; you're working with bright engineers, designers, and data scientists who all have incredible drive and talent. It's a great place to grow and learn. This has been Uber's biggest value prop to technical members of staff to date, and it still holds true. You have the opportunity to work on world-class platforms and build product experiences from scratch, which is cool no matter how you slice it.\r\n\r\nDespite Uber's public woes, there's clearly an earnest effort by executive leadership to solve the company's cultural problems. Liane Hornsey has led a mighty effort to systematically address the many, many accumulated issues that Uber has accrued. Dara seems right-headed as well, and seems keen on addressing his (very accurate, I believe) read on the company's problems. \r\n\r\nThe catered food is free and pretty great. There are some down days in quality, but anyone who says the food sucks is probably just accustomed to the likes of Google or Facebook's excellent free fare."

998,no cons detected within my experience,"Uber is without a doubt one the best places a person can work for these days. And there are only few such companies exist. The most dynamic environment where life changing projects are born. If you are brave enough to change the world, don't afraid to hustle and willing to meet best professionals - Uber is a very right place."
999,"Sometimes it´s complicate, just because as everyone can express your opinion, have a clear guide or take a quick decision can take more time then expected.","it´s a highly disruptive way to work, all can make your point and the idea it´s that everyone are being heard.

1008,"You will be treated like a child. Your manager will be paid more than you to do absolutely no work at all except for complain about how little work you do, even if you're one of the top performers. It's so hard to put into words how horribly you'll be treated here.  Despite Meritocracy being a cultural value, favoritism runs rampant and there is nothing you can do about it. They will tell you they value your input and then do the opposite of what your pain points are. Bottom performers are praised or settled with, rather than asking them to do their job. It's literally so hard to even conceptualize how awful it is. Over half of the agents in my department are looking for new jobs because of how bad it is, and we've all been here for over a year.","Decent pay, amazing benefits. Only reason I'm still here."

They don’t have a quality control process in place to ensure that food delivery is sanitary and protected. Their training is based on a short YouTube films. They use the same drivers that pick up people. Their drivers are not trained properly. Don’t be surprised if you receive your UberEATS order by a kid on a bicycle without any warming bag (this may be acceptable if you live in Manhattan or densely populated urban area). I really take great pride and time to ensure my customers receive a hot and fresh meal. Quality of delivery is just as important as quality of food preparation and service. To pay a partner (UberEATS) 30% of my net sales and have them not ensure quality of delivery is unexpectable. Don’t try complaining to higher ups because your complaints will go unanswered. I am really concerned for the public and restaurants who partner with UberEATS because they are both risking safety and business liability.

Be part of the Uber family. Endless, steep learning curve. Tons of room for your own initiatives into making the company better, also if the initiative lies outside your function. Work with the smartest friendliest people in a company that is actively working with employees to transform into an example for other companies, not just in terms of tech, but also in terms of culture and HR."
1065,Culture is toxic and change will take time.,People are smart. Interesting problem space.
1066,-Lots of work to do.,"-A totally different experience where you have something new to learn everyday! \r\n-It is full of very talented people \r\n-The Company has an out of the box mindset, always open to new ideas to keep improving, so that is also a way you can grow and learn every day\r\n-Very results-oriented; they trust the employees and the different ways of working\r\n-There is an everyday effort to make employees happy\r\n-You can grow as fast as the Company is growing."
1067,Organizational structure as some people work for multiple post,Learning is endless but everyone is very supportive
1068,Terrible culture and management team. No work life balance. Extremely long working hours and hard to get vacation days to recharge.  You have to work even when you are sick.,Lots of smart and young engineers to work with. But the working environment is competitive instead of collaborative. You need to be very aggressive and good at stepping on other's shoulder to move up.
1069,Bad communication from supervisors for certain events.,Was great learning about marketing for a new company
1070,for me there are no cons,"The perks are great, management is okay"
1071,"Leadership. Some of the down side to working at Uber, unfortunately, is the people in a position that allows for bad team leads that are antagonist allowing inappropriate commentary to be made. The majority of contacts that we handle are global and diverse, yet, within the COE, diversity it's intolerant. There is no other support besides an English language support so many times contacts are resolved due to \","Where do I begin? Working here is literally anyone's dream job who loves social networking! I have only been here for 3 months (celebrated my Uberversity today) and I love it. The location is a pro in itself. You get to see Phoenix from an amazing high rise view. If you work a morning shift or late shift, watching the sunrise and the sunset of Camelback Mountain, South Mountain and the city is just breathtaking. Besides working for an amazing brand, the location I thank them for choosing.  We also get catered lunch everyday; enjoying Indian, Mexican, Thai etc.  cuisine's. We have flavored water and unlimited snacks and drinks!! Parking is complimentary or public transportation. We have 100% health, eye and dental insurance coverage. You will also work right in the middle of just about the best area in Phoenix!! Easy access to the hottest everything going down in AZ! On top of all this, Uber, also, in addition gives us other perks that are, yet, again AMAZING and you'll have to just wait to find out for yourself!!\r\n\r\nThe COE (Center of Excellent) is mainly social and email support with priority teams who may provide phone support in certain cases. So the environment is nice and you don't hear much talking like you would at a call center. Everyday we are interacting via the #1 global platforms of the social media world responding to people via social every single minute of our lives! A non stressful job with the only head phones around your head is for the pleasure of your music selection. \r\n\r\nThis company would honestly be great if they just get management to actually follow their own cultural values."
1072,"I work away from San Francisco and the internal challenges Uber faces are more SF based.  The external challenges are more global.  You need to really believe in the current and long term goals of the company, you will question yourself and be questioned by others but you truely believe then you will become a great advocate for the change, both internal and external we are making.",Moving from a non tech company to a tech one has been the best decision I have made.  Uber does not lie when they say they are fast paced and rapidly changing.  If you come with a confidence that you can contribute in your own way and are comfortable in pursuing those ambitions without needing to be checked each step of the way then this is the company for you.  If you feel you are not able to make a decisions without approval from someone else then you will struggle.

1080,"- No career opportunities for smaller markets/teams\r\n\r\n- Worst management I've ever had, no one cares about us.

1081,Not easy to love a firm that is currently undergoing so many bad reviews... Gap between press and reality might be sometimes challenging.,"If you have a strong, independent, fast past and creative mind you will love working at Uber. Trust towards employee's creativity and ideas make my job really enjoyable. I also get as much support and guidance from my management and team that independence in my daily tasks and projects. Also, if you are a team person and not averse to risk nor to changement, Uber is the right place to be. You will learn and grow faster than in any other firm ! And I personally feel that I will never get bored which is one of my main request when embracing a new position."
1082,"Almost everything else, I loved working with other distributors and providing this fun, new service in LA, but Uber cooperate was never the best at communication or providing benefits with it's workers, unlike UberX, distributors needed to be dependably on time at various partnered restaurants six days a week, driving to and from distro sites and  dispensing food to the Uber drivers for delivery.  We were classified as 10-99, but had to fulfill the demands and expectations of a full time employee.","All the free food, but after your first hundred subs, you'll l never eat another godmother from Bay Cities again."

Changes actually happen. The company never stays the same, and is ever evolving, which makes this company one of a kind."
1091,"The external perception of Uber can be unfair. Also, if you're looking for great salaries and titles and career trajectory, look elsewhere. People work here for the work directly in front of them and the ability to impact the future with it. If you need a title to justify your self worth, you won't get it here. Also, if you're outside a main hub, there's no growth opportunities.","Amazing work! Some of the most satisfying and challenging work in my 10 year professional career. Peers are the smartest most inspiring professionals that challenge you. I'm sure you've read the news and articles about how Uber is a terrible place. In my experience, those articles for the most part take a minor thing out of context and sensationalize it. It's easy to pick on big bad Uber, but the truth is the people here care deeply about getting things right for our drivers and riders and put some incredible talent behind it. Sometimes we make mistakes, but there's been something so rewarding about living through and contributing to a mission and a company that has served as an inflection point in our society."

I've spoken or worked with her directly, but in site wide meetings she always seems like someone you wouldn't want to cross paths with. \r\nTraining was a bit too long.

1101,"-The staff; when they're not pounding Uber's asinine and excessive 14 company values into your head, they are spending absurd amounts of time telling you about how negative press or public opinion is just wrong. \r\n- From the moment you begin, you are expected to fully adhere to any and all rules and regulations. There is no space for learning curves. \r\n-You never know who your supervisor is until you complete four weeks of training. \r\n-The shifts you have to or could work are entirely different than the shift you are trained to work.",Benefits for employees are exceptional

1104,Things outside of your hands can sometimes cause lots of difficulty during the workday.,Uber has a great company culture of inclusion and diversity. It's a great place to be right now!

1107,"No surprises here: Travis. The leadership. Performance. Growth. It's all as bad as it seems, if not worse. The longer you've been there, the more legacy actually can hold you back. The glass ceiling actually feels especially low for women.","I arrived early enough (2014) to carve out a one-of-a-kind role for myself. Uber was young enough to still truly feel like a startup and for it to attract truly brilliant employees. I was, and still am, inspired by my peers and the approach and speed at which they solve problems."
1108,I will let you know when I find out,-Great team work\r\n-Amazing benefits\r\n-A job that encourages people to be themselves as well as celebrating diversity
1109,Sometimes it feels to me that the company should have more age diversity. It seems to me that Teams should have some more senior people.,"Very agile, fast paced company. I love how good ideas scale fast in here."
1110,"Uber is about as toxic as it can get in terms of places to work.  There's a macho, fratty atmosphere and everyone is expected to do battle for everything. You compete against your own teammates and are forced to be an aggressive to survive and climb the ranks. Even doing things that are ethically wrong are encouraged, so long as it's good for the business/growth.",It's a fast-paced environment with little oversight on your day-to-day work

1112,Below-average salary for associates and interns,"Great culture, good learning opportunities"
1113,"Uber moves quickly. Most of the time that means having exciting and challenging projects. However, that also means projects occasionally breaking down. In those instances, it would be more useful for team members to take a step back and figure out how to move forward together.","Brilliant people, challenging opportunities, and the ability to be a part of a rapidly expanding global company."

The stars have aligned: I like my manager and his style, I like the team I'm on, and I like the work that we're doing within the Uber Advanced Technology Group. My manager is very flexible and emphasizes the balance of life and work."
1125,Work hours are insane. Some days went up to 12-16 hours and there were times were I had to work weekends. There is also a disconnect from old employees with large equity shares in the company and newer employees. They see newer employees as a potential threat and this can sometimes cause strenuous office politics.,"Great culture. Strong start-up feel to the company and my co-workers were dynamic. Workplace was open-space, meaning you're not stuck in a cubicle and can sometimes work remotely. Managers were great at communicating as there's a very open communication culture in which they will try to work with your issues."
1126,I have not come across any cons in my time here.,A very positive atmosphere.
1127,"The systemic paternalism and bro-culture is absolutely real. If you're a woman, be prepared to be chronically cut off mid-sentence, 'forgotten' off meeting invites and second-guessed. Depending on the team you're in, you'll be the only woman around. If you're unfortunate enough to enter a team that's been together for a long time, you have to really work hard to be included, but don't be too pushy - or else you'll get dinged for it on your Performance Review. I kind of feel like you can't win.","Super-smart colleagues, incredibly interesting projects, wonderful drivers. The Susan Fowler post opened up a gaping wound in the company's inner workings that I'd say are being genuinely worked on with very deep introspection.

I have worked at some of the top tech companies in the past, but the pace at which Uber moves something else."
1129,"Rapid growth has resulted in some lag in organizational development. In other words, lots of developers without much framework like PMs or tech writers to help guide and amplify everyone's contribution. It can be challenging to work someplace that receives significant negative press.","Interesting new technology, kind intelligent co-workers, strong potential financial upside, yummy snacks, reasonable work-life-balance."
1130,Lack of alignment in some orgs. Lots of re orgs. Not all Managers are fare. Favorites and friends benefit. Managers are not technical don't know enough about candidates and perf is in their hands as they represent you in calibration. Culture is more like deliveries over employees well being. You are expected to stretch indirectly through peer pressure. Highly competitive environment.,Amazing tech stack. Good challenges. Good product offering. Good tech infrastructure. Great energy and peers. Rapidly changing environment. Leadership is open to feedback and seems like they will act on it.
1131,It is really innovating organization which has become the need of almost everyone.,UBER is an amzing company
1132,If I can find any i will be sure to let you know.,Amazing quality of life after working with Uber. Never have to really worry about food or finances.
1133,Because they promote within so much and most of Uber employees are in their 20's their can sometimes be managers that are a tid bit inexperienced.,"Amazing Benefits, Free Lunch, Free Uber Rides, truly amazing culture, stable, quickly to promote, growing fast, competitive pay for entry level positions, very nice office, gym reimbursement, and lastly full of young people."

1137,The downside is the same as the up. Uber's culture brings out the worst in employees who aren't conditioned for competitiveness.,Uber's work environment is increasingly more competitive everyday and it's encouraged through Uber's core principles.
1138,Constant policy changes (might not be a bad thing for some people),"Great benefits, competitive pay, awesome atmosphere and love the management"
1139,"Compensation is heavily tied to the growth (stock) in the company, less salary than other firms seeking competitive talent.","The amount of data here is truly amazing. If you are a data geek or someone that enjoys analytics this is a great company to work for. \r\nPeople/Culture fit is a huge part of the interview process. They are looking for open-minded individuals, that can help bring creative ideas to teams while also being a team player."

Downtown SF if you are local. I really don't have 20 positive words to list so this is just verbiage to comply with
1141,"Point system is strict, and takes a year to fall off. Although you can move departments, there really isn't an option to move up. They drill it in that you can move up, and its easy, to move up; That's not true. No room at desks. We sit at long tables with no dividers or space. It can sometimes be loud and hard to make important calls.\r\n  Its trendy, and a lot like high school. Rumors, jocks and cheerleaders. A lot of fraternization, and favoritism by management. Others can be harsh and judge your work..    \r\n   Most management have no idea what they are doing and spend a lot of time chatting, or texting on their phone. If there is an issue, good luck. There are a lot of things that take place that would NEVER happen at another employer.

I'm hopeful that the immaturity will be addressed and the office can become more professional.","They have great health benefits, and the pay scale just changed and is reasonable, but not livable for anyone with responsibilities. Dress is causal, and they cater lunch daily. There is a stocked kitchen that is impressive, and free for employees. We also get Uber credits monthly which are used to pay for UberEats orders. The location is central, with great views of downtown. Leadership is lax, and not much is taken seriously. There are nearly 50 shifts to choose from, though most are at odd hours, during days, evening, nights and all holidays. Its open 24 hours. \r\n   They are awesome with time off, and allow you to go negative. They also offer parent time which is for school related events like parent teacher or the dreaded recorder concert. They are involved in a lot of community events and things happening around town."
1142,"Poor Leadership with no experience which makes for poor quality of work being produced. Its young, and trendy which results in immaturity and drama.  No space between desks which so speaking on the phone awful. \r\n  They preach upward mobility within, however its more lateral. Education isn't valued here","They are adjusting the pay, free food, perks, great health benefits.  They are generous with time off, and they offer parent time as well which is nice."
1143,"The payment had a delay for some weeks, last 2 weeks was ok. Sometimes is not possible to be trained in time for the needed department .","Great place to work, with an enviroment to help the needy on the platform. Nice structure of resources and kindy people in all of the LOBs."
1144,"- Uber has a bad reputation and is constantly the subject of controversy, protests, and negative press. While Uber is not perfect, I do believe the company has matured since its early years and leadership does take these matters seriously from what I've seen. If you can't handle seeing a negative headline about your employer, Uber may not be for you, but for those that can handle it and want to make a positive impact on our culture and reputation, this shouldn't be an issue.\r\n- Teams and people can shift around frequently as the company continues to grow. This is probably a good thing overall for the company but it can feel jarring at times.\r\n- People work hard–not necessarily because of deadlines but because many of their coworkers are smart, driven, and hard-working people so the bar is set high (that's my experience at least). This is ultimately what you make of it–many people stay late but many people also get into work past 10:00am. Remote work is pretty flexible too which is a plus.","- Uber has hired some of the best people in the industry. I've never worked with more intelligent and driven people.\r\n- Compensation, perks, and benefits were very competitive with companies of similar size.\r\n- The technology stack has matured considerably after some initial growing pains. Engineers can provision infrastructure and build/deploy services without excessive red tape.\r\n- Surprisingly strong, positive cultural values. They are really woven into every day work–used as hashtags, referenced by leadership, etc. Most other companies just create a list of cultural values and forget them."

1161,"The opportunities to move up are very few. They indicate that there is plenty of oppotunities to grow and move up in the company, but it hasn't happened for the 6 months I've been there. The work schedule is never set. It can change in a month, in a few weeks or in a few months. The company doesn't really provide any feedback as to how we are doing. You would think we would get a 6 month review and possible increase in pay...nope that hasn't happened.",Uber takes care of its employees well. There are plenty of nice amenities they provide. You get a lot of discounts from places.
1162,"culture, culture, culture, work-life balance, growth rate","perks, couches, chairs, technology, smart people"
1163,"High stress level, out-of-touch management, poorly developed processes, minimal training, and a false sense of community.","Decent pay, great benefits, supportive peers."
1164,Too much favoritism. And no room for growth. Promises they never keep. They can't handle strong minded employees.,Stay busy. If you love helping people and have massive empathy.
1165,Intense pressure to get all things done immediately leading to high levels of burnout\r\nPerformance reviews could be more transparent,"Energetic, can-do attitude\r\nLow levels of bureaucracy\r\nAbility to clearly see the impact of your work in the environment around you"
1166,Share info a little slower,Awesome place to work with a great culture
1167,There's always people who don't take so much care about the place.,They actually take care of the employees.
1168,"Low pay rate, feedback and training","benefits and environment, culture and values"
1169,All jobs are not like this one,culture team  amazing company
1170,If you don't work in a major city you might not get as much attention as in a major city,Employee Perks\r\nFun Team\r\nSimple chain of command\r\nLots of room for personal initiative
1171,I honestly cant find a Con in my personal experience.,Uber prepares you and gives you the assets to succeed within the company. Theres so much room for growth that it keeps you extremely motivated to try your hardest to expand your knowledge within the Uber brand.
1172,"Politics. Too much of it. Left the company within a year since I could not handle the continuous nepotism, criticism etc of work. We are expected to work like crazy and anyone who does anything other than work is frowned upon. No work life balance. Not worth joining now that the upside is also not much. \n\nRecruiters talk trash of Uber being a $500 B company in the future. I would be surprised if they even sustain their current valuation.",Company is growing fast. Lots of technical challenges. Less of legacy baggage.
1173,"Personally, i cannot complaint about anything.","The company has an awesome and clear mission. Knowing that your work directly impacts mobility of millions of riders and income for millions of drivers is extremely motivating. In addition, working on innovation towards a robotic company is awesome. The environment is perfect for working towards challenging problems and there are no politics. Extremely talented and intelligent people around."
1174,After 3 months - none for now. Not saying that they won't appear. None job is perfect :),Young teams with amazing knowledge\r\nGreat atmosphere with social priveleges\r\nTeam binding every month\r\nTandem which will upgrade your skills\r\nWork which make you happy when solving problems\r\n#beyourself all the time
1175,So far I don't see any,"Work/ life balance, culture & values."
1176,"Only for people who like a challenge and thrive in a rewarding team environment...Not really con, is it ?! :-)","Fast-paced, dynamic, challenging, Fun and Very rewarding environment. \r\nSense of accomplishment and growth.\r\nSuperior Health benefits, Food, Snacks, Rides...\r\nI finally found my perfect environment!"
1177,Lots of work as working in small team,Working with a small but awesome team
1178,Long hours and tight deadlines can get stressful at times. Time management is key to success at Uber. People have the tendency to absorb themselves fully.,Exciting opportunities to grow into various roles. Real end to end exposure. Teams are highly motivated and driven to achieve high results. Passion for the cause is immense.
1179,Difficulties with current problems surrounding Uber.,"Flexibility, room for growth, intelligent colleagues, work/life balance."
1180,It can be intimidating.,"You're working with the brightest minds on the planet benefits, perks and attentiveness to both physical and mental health as overall well-being is unlike anything I've seen. Its absolutely mind-blowing to see your work almost instantaneously changing the world!"
1181,Long hours but in a very nice environment.,"Great working atmosphere, great people and great company culture."
1182,That this was only a temporary position,That is has a excellent work environment along with a wonderful staff.
1183,lot of pressure and cannot have private life,work with very pro people
1184,"the drivers (always having something negative to say) when they are not even working for uber as the company, they are partners... however working for Uber as employees we are always looking for a way to make things better for the drivers",* Flexibitly \r\n* Diversity \r\n* job security and advancement\r\n* work life balance\r\n* pay and benefits
1185,The team that I am part of is very small and there isnt too much room to move up or around. I would have to move to a larger city to see more career potential with Uber.  More a city con than a company one.,The people that I work with are all amazing.  Everyone is always in high spirit and makes the days go by so fast!  Uber is also always changing and expanding and because of that there are always new projects on the go.  Makes for a fun and adaptive environment to work in.
1186,"Lack of communications between departments, Hourly pay is not enough.","Great people to work with, smart and team players. Management also great, growing company and  options to move on within the company, and great benefits"
1187,Management will let u go for no reason with out warning,Great company to work for very friendly environment
1188,"- Apparently, a lack of transparency. I was oblivious to all of the scandals that have been in the news lately, which disturbs me.\r\n- If you don't believe in all the values, you won't fit in. The values are basically not available publicly, and I don't know if they are shared with candidates during recruiting, so make sure you find out what they are.\r\n- It seems like the IPO may be more elusive than at other startups. One starts to wonder if they are putting it off to squeeze more work out of the employees.\r\n- I don't know how common this is, but I was terminated, to the great sadness and detriment of my team, by a higher level manager for seemed like an irrelevant issue.\r\n- Remote work is severely discouraged.","- You get to be part of a historic change in the way people work. Whether that change is for the good will be up to history...\r\n- Some of the engineering challenges are interesting and hard and being tackled by few others. (Lots of other challenges are being tackled by lots of competitors, and I don't know whether they would be better to work for.)\r\n- Guided by a strong mission and set of core values. If you believe in them, you will fit in well and they can keep you going through the long hours."
1189,I think I've only a very personal comment which is about the time it takes to me to get on the COE. Nothing more.,"This is the best place I've ever seen! Uber is fully worried about employees' experience working in it and this is visible not only with direct employees, but with partners (as drivers) too! Love this place!"
1190,"No comments at time, maybe the Human resources to improve more attention in benefits parts","Can be me, I have many opportunities for improve my professional here. So hapy because i was recognized as suberwoman in LATAM. This is a great compensation."
1191,Not being recognized for the work you do and the experience you bring to the table.,Uber is a great place to work. The people are amazing and the environment is challenging.
1192,"The uncultured culture, the extreme lack of structure, the unchecked need to grow too fast, and the lack of guidance","The medical benefits are superb, the exposure to other countries is there, and the opportunity to gain experience is there."
1193,nothing everyones positive and delighting,great pay and a good learning experience
1194,there are none. All is ok.,Friendship. Values. All compensations and benefits.
1195,Nothing at this moment. I am very glad.,-Great enviroment.\r\n-Oportunity to grow.\r\n- A place to develop your persolanity.\r\n-You can be yourself.
1196,Could make more money somewhere else,"flexible schedule, casual work environment, catered lunch, good people to work alongside"
1197,"Some information might be hard to get, values aren't spread too well throughout the company","Friendly environment, nice recognition, a company that cares about their employees"
1198,I haven't found any yet,"Work environment, cafeteria's food, people"
1199,"Nothing at all, i love this job","Its simple, the best job in the world"
1200,Work-life balance might be a little too shifted to the work side,Always hustling and with the support of the most intelligent and amazing people
1201,I still can not find,Is the best job in the world
1202,None really.  Left as I wanted to get out of San Francisco.,"Fun, laid back environment with a good work culture."
1203,Lack of direction in a customer facing environment. Management is not aware on how to manage employees.,It's nice starting with a new company to get in from the ground up
1204,there is not much to say that i do not like so far! i think there should be more gym perks but thats about it!,exposure to lots of knowledge and new ideas . people that work here are very talented and have an amazing drive to success! they are also amazing people to hang out with !
1205,- Leadership needs improvement (at HQ),"- Amazing people: smart, driven, helpful, ambitious\r\n- Impactful work: transforming lives and cities\r\n- Trust in the employee\r\n- Rooting for you to succeed"
1206,"- No 401k (however, you're compensated with equity)","- Work on self driving technology (absolutely interesting stuff)\r\n- Close knit co-working environment (Pittsburgh)\r\n- Get setup with whatever you need (macbooks, standing desks, headphones, etc..)\r\n- Great work-life balance\r\n- Uber credits"
1207,Not a lot of growth in the city I am in. If I want to move upward I would have to relocate and I'd rather not leave my home state for I want to see it grow exponentially and contribute to my community and be close to family and friends. I love where I live and I don't want to give that up at this point.,Open-floor concept in all offices. Makes it feel more like a community than an office space. Hours are great and the pay is enough to get by with. Opportunities are endless but only if you're willing to move.
1208,"Obviously Uber is still a start-up (even though it's a really big one) and it has grown a lot, so many people are very inexperienced (even though they're super smart and hard working) and some things could be better organized, but I am optimistic about the future.","The people are really positive, smart and enthusiastic. I love the collaboration and team spirit. I also love solving real-world problems."
1209,"Poor communication, outsourced but wasn't upfront about it, poor listeners, had 401K setup but did not match, asked for a new manager as mine second one was awful, request denied. It was awful.","Absolutely no pros, unfortunately"
1210,"High pressured environment, that can often be relentless",Great culture and autonomy to grow
1211,"Things move at lightspeed, and as we've seen the last month, it's not always perfect as a result. People come to Uber to kick butt in the best possible way. If that's you, you're in for a treat. But that's necessarily for everyone.","Despite all the events over the last month, I see every day a truly incredible place where every single person can have tremendous impact. Uber holds itself to a high bar, and it certainly isn't perfect. But it's still a great place.\r\n\r\nUber has gotten larger, which just means I can't speak to every place in the company from first-hand knowledge. But from what I've seen with my own eyes in my area, the environment has been remarkably supportive, energizing, and positive.\r\n\r\nI've been at other companies where the environment was actually _systematically_ problematic, so perhaps my spectrum for judging company cultures is different from all the press we're getting. But that is not Uber. There's a remarkably high degree of transparency here, and a remarkably low degree of BS. Uber is under quite a lot of scrutiny, and in part that's a consequence of the company's success. The company has increased in size several-fold, and the culture is still growing up. Again, I can only speak to my own experience, but I've loved Uber from the moment I've joined and every day since, for the problems I work on, for the people I work with, for the trajectory I'm afforded, for the technical areas I have the opportunity to master, for the richness of the data, for the mission of the company, and for the company's earnest desire to always be improving. This place is for real, and the growth is real."
1212,"Many of the best engineers have moved on due to the chaotic work environment and management favoritism toward those creating new things, rather than successfully implementing or running things. Middle management is not supportive in any way. Managers will find and latch onto your flaws, using them as justification to keep you from receiving raises, or promotions. Several teams are traps, existing only to provide their manager with headcount, and struggle to find a purpose. There is next to no coaching, and no training. Teamwork is not valued, only delivering new things. New employees receive terrible credit benefits. The catered meals are a trap. There is a pattern to there not being enough seats at any of the cafeterias, so lunch must be taken at your desk, while dinner isn't served until 8:15pm.","Many very smart, motivated people to work with on big problems; if you're on the right team. A very fast pace of change. Nice, albeit overly-flashy, facilities. The best-run IT department I've ever had the pleasure of working with."
1213,There weren't many cos for me. I really enjoyed working with the company.,The money and hours were great. My coworker were fun

1215,Always have to be available,"Innovative, little bureaucracy, best idea wins, flexible"
1216,A lot of processes are still unstructured. Ghosts from Uber's startup past still haunts the company's reputation worldwide,Working with Uber an adventure - you do different things and meet different people on a daily basis. Cross-functional and cross-regional work are facilitated by transparent discussions and collaborative team members. Be part of the online revolution.
1217,"- POLITICS (even if you try to avoid them you are negatively impacted)\n- Bad hires: In the beginning I think Uber hired a lot of great talent and good people but now it is growing so fast that they are not hiring well, and they are hiring a ton of jerks that do not care about the people or culture and make people feel like you should just be lucky to work at Uber. It's sad - a lot of good talented people are being treated poorly and no one seems to care.\n- No work life balance: expect to work all day, everyday and weekends and to feel like you are still not doing enough\n- No real recognition: Even if you work 24/7 and are good at what you do expect to be told you aren't doing enough and to wonder why you aren't being taken care of financially. This is leading to burn out and vets of the company leaving\n- Trust: Everyone is out to protect themselves and will throw you under the bus to look good really quickly, no one trusts anyone anymore","When I first started at Uber I was really excited and knew that there would be a ton of opportunity for growth professionally, and I knew it would be a challenge but I was ready to work hard. When I started in 2014 you could feel the energy and excitement, which has mostly gone away at this point. There are still a ton of great employees there and I made great connections. Free food and Uber credits are nice and they do have a good benefits package."
1218,"At Uber it is a fast-changing environment, work-life balance.","Excellent work culture, access to technology and resources, young and enthusiastic team with go-getter attitudes, fast-changing environment, ability to chart your own path and implement ideas"
1219,I don't have negative feedback for now.,I'm really happy how high skill level of engineering we have in our local office as well as in HQ. Also everyone in the team is very friendly and I would say that we have quite healthy atmosphere in the company overall.
1220,Uber is not for people who like things easy.,I feel like I'm taken care of at Uber. It's a job for passionate people who want to make an impact.
1221,I dont have any thing to say here soo far,"i got a leasing specialist position with uber like 3 months ago and i think i made my best decision so far , it is an impecable company to work for , nice manager nice co workers, they treat there people soo good"
1222,Intense!  The super day is back to back and they certainly test you,Very transparent about the role and the challenges people face.  Efficient and timely interview process. Everyone is honest and willing to give your their opinion.
1223,Pay could be increased more,Loved it for the while
1224,- Salary under market given the quality of the team\r\n- Work hard without paid extra hour,- Fast learning curve\r\n- Freedom to develop projects and skills\r\n- New challenges everyday\r\n- Perks
1225,None so far. maybe a little the stress handling.,"Great exposure, and very dynamic company."
1226,"Cannot think of any.  Long hours during busy seasons, but that's universal for all finance / accounting jobs.",Smart people to work with; supportive leadership; opportunity to work on interesting projects and sometimes even to build / shape things rather than just following an established procedure without knowing why.
1227,Sometimes the amount of work is overwhelming.,"Great people, great company, fast learning... super excited to be here!"
1228,None that I can think of,Professional team mates.\r\nExcellent management.\r\nVery good technical knowledge
1229,"- The performance review system is fundamentally broken. Who gets how much is a roll of the dice. Large initial equity grants blunt this to some extent though and management assures us it's being worked on so I'm cautiously optimistic. \r\n- While the culture of my own organization is good (people have integrity, women and minorities are treated respectfully by management), the bad behavior going on elsewhere still hurts.\r\n- Hours can be long but are flexible. You control your own destiny but it can be hard for some to unplug when necessary.\r\n- Almost all engineers are white, Indian or Chinese straight men. Not an overtly discriminatory environment but management does not demonstrate that they value diversity.","- Level of responsibility is way beyond anything I've experienced at other companies. \r\n- Huge potential for an individual engineer or small team to impact the business. \r\n- Easy to develop a strong sense of ownership for your part of the product. \r\n- Perks and benefits are really nice without being ridiculous (free snacks but not free laundry).\r\n- Coworkers are all very smart and hard working. Slackers are managed out. \r\n- Many opportunities to learn new technologies. \r\n- Real, tangible impact on how people move around cities, not just selling ads or building some nonsense app."

1231,"Fast moving means uncertainty.  If you're someone that loves working in startup culture then the job is for you, but if not then you'll struggle.","Fast pace culture.  If you're looking for a company where new ideas and fast moving product are the norm, Uber is your place.  Tons of perks, and the Chicago office is well positioned in the West Loop."
1232,"* Longer than normal hours (compared to other SV firms like Google and Facebook). The longer hours aren't imposed. It's more like you feel inspired to build or improve something that you own. \r\n* Bad brand PR. Uber is one of the most villified tech companies. While most employees believe these opinions to be based on misinformation, it's demoralizing to know some people see Uber as the \","* Opportunity for impact. The per-capita impact for each engineer is higher than most other tech firms. At Uber, each engineer has a real impact to the company's bottom-line. This really drives the ownership culture and is inspiring to see. \r\n* Culture that promotes standing up for what you believe in. If you feel strongly about something, the company encourages you to voice your opinion, even if there's a large discrepancy in rank. At the end of the day, the right idea should win.\r\n* Exponential personal growth.  The engineers who survive here will experience rapid growth in engineering abilities. I learned more in the first 6 months at Uber than I did in the previous 2 years at large tech behemoth. \r\n* Competitive compensation\r\n* Convenient perks - free food, monthly credits for Uber and UberEATS"
1233,"**Culture**\r\nThe culture at Uber is not healthy. Its move fast and only about results at all cost. The impact on our customers or employees does not matter. There has been much in the news about \r\n\r\n**Career Growth**\r\nThere is no career growth or logical career path. You are working to work and hoping that the equity would be worth something someday. There are re-orgs every 3 - 6 months which force you to learn new skill sets. \r\n\r\n**Management**\r\nFirst time managers are a huge problem with no training.

1246,"- As with any other company, as it grows, political environment at work takes a toll on employees (if you're the loudest, you get farther)\r\n- Hit-and-miss with immediate managers-- you might get a manager who'll help you maximize your talents, but you'll also work with some who don't care about you except for their own interests\r\n- Long hours (well, this is a pro if you're a workaholic), so get ready to have your personal time confused with your work time\r\n- Great benefits (free lunch in almost any country where Uber's based at), but need to have higher base salaries for the amount of work you put into the company\r\n- You get promoted based on perception-- if you've done what your managers say despite being the wrong way to approach a project/task, then you'll go far-- Even if part of the culture is stepping on toes, once you start lobbying for what's right, if your co-workers don't like you, it's easy to get isolated from the rest\r\n- You have to build while on-the-fly-- if you're someone who has to think for a long time and assess a situation before you act on it (even if it's the right thing to do sometimes), don't bother applying. You won't fit in and a lot of people/projects will pass you by","- Most Intelligent, Talented, and Diverse set of individuals you can work with\r\n- Training and access to resources will help you learn and grow in whichever field you're from\r\n- Everyone's helpful\r\n- Folks are passionate about the brand and the product, almost cult-like\r\n- Quality/Competence of people is standardized globally-- I've worked with a lot of folks in my position based all over the world and everyone seems to have sound, technical backgrounds and expertise. You'd be hard-pressed to find co-workers who haven't done anything significant prior to entering Uber (not to say there aren't a few who slip through the cracks)"
1247,There is very little to learn. The company is full of new college grads who hardly know how to write maintainable code. The company has a very little sense of direction and believes in throwing money at every problem.\r\n\r\nThe CEO believes that employee should at least put in 80 hrs/week. No work like balance.,Great Brand name. Exposure to some great problems in the industry.
1248,"well, new team/company comes with limited tools, processes, and resources; so I am wearing multiple hats; but I don't think this is a Cons since this helps you to grow to be the better of yourself from the career stands point, and not rather a burden.  The only Cons i would have to say is, I wish there is a Uber shuttle from south bay.","Great teamwork, open communication, lots of collaboration efforts so you don't feel you hit the end dead or being a dead weight, per se. The Company is very open for anything you want to say; weekly company update feels like you are part of the crew; like owning it and not renting it.  If you want challenges, this is the right place; good for your careers and develop lots of skills while at it!  The team i am in now, it's great to be part of as we are scaling globally and be part of this team is an honor and privilege.  You don't get to be part of the young team that will shape billion people around the world when using Uber Apps for nothing, especially you are defining that team's process, end to end scopes and evangelize Localization best practices."

This office also promotes heavily based on seniority, so if you're neither, I recommend you look for another job.\r\n\r\nSurviving in this office has nothing to do with merit.

You get 15 free trips up to $15 a month, and lunch is served every day. The office is also in a great location, so it's nice to meet up with friends after work."
1264,"None of it, I am happy at Uber",Fun and creative working environment
1265,The hours are long and sometimes I am exhausted but I also get 3 days off so thats a plus!,"This job is probably my favorite one that I have ever had! The culture is amazing. Not only are most people friendly here, but they all have great passion for what they do. I have made not only work friends but a couple have become personal friends as well. Yes we all love the free food everyday, however I truly believe that Uber is a place that makes dreams come true! I have seen so much passion and excitement in myself and my coworkers because we know what we have to do to make our dreams come true. And best of all they are attainable! I have been trained in 3 different departments and I have only been a Full Time Employee for 3 months!"
1266,Not too much cons. Putting way too much effort on product features instead of long term investment on the engineer culture. Maybe it's just my team.,"You get to exposed to lots of tech stacks, from Python, Node, to Go and Java. You get to learn things super fast, tons of opportunitis to learn open source tools and data engineer pipelines."
1267,Only women could be seen and get credit even with mans doing The samethings and having The exactly same skills. But what was ridiculous and discrepant were the procedures when men and women made mistakes. Any male error was passive from severe punishments such as dismissal and the same mistakes of women were left aside. All with knowledge of two ccos misandrias and incompentents.,"Flexibility, good equipment , learning a lot about bad people"

It's manageable to deal with, but I'd prefer to have the weekends off every week.","Uber treats its employees very well. I have had the privilege to work for Uber over the last several months, & I have never been happier. Between the satisfaction I get from the work I do to advance the Self Driving Uber project, to the benefits & pay I receive for doing it, & enjoying being around the people I work with, there might not be a better company to work for."

Starting from recruiting process, I was very happy at the end of the process, thinking that if I didn't get the job, it was all worth it. On day 3 I was feeling fully ready to deliver, thanks to great company values and clear targets. Hearing founder & CEO Travis' insights every week on the staff call has further inspired me."
1273,None so far. Uber is just amazing!,A healthy and fun environment! Working with Uber is a humbling experience. Sharing good practices and open to possibilities.

I sat at four desks in my first month and it took me two months to get my first meeting with one of my managers. It's not uncommon to have actual \,"Uber has some of the best tooling in the industry for Engineers. Its extremely engineer-centric, as an engineer you're definitely a first class citizen at Uber. Great snacks, ride credits, and free rides to/from caltrain and after 10pm are top of the line perks. Catered lunches and dinners (although only if you stay until 8:15pm). HUGE growth, it's common to see your team double every 6 months."

1279,"If you want a company where everything is processed and organized, this is not the place for you. Uber is still learning and trying to understand itself internally, so you have to be flexible with the ebb and flows. Uber may not be a \","Uber is growing FAST. And with that growth comes a lot of change. Every employee, whether you're entry-level or an executive has a voice and no matter who you are or what you do, the best idea ALWAYS wins. I've been wanting to work for Uber for the last 3 years and now that I'm here, it has not disappointed."
1280,"The Advanced Technology side is a very fluid environment so if you don't like a fast paced, consistently changing environment, this might take some getting used to.",We are literally on the ground floor of this new and exciting technology. Uber has given the chance to travel to new cities and make new friends in this exciting and fast paced environment. There is always someone willing to help and the perks and benefits seem to be never ending.
1281,"There can be political issues on some teams.  People can get very competitive, cut-throat and bro-y.  It's definitely a place where your appearance of working and your relationship with higher-up's hugely defines your success.","We are working on super interesting projects and people are highly encouraged to own their own projects and take charge.  There is a high potential to grow and learn both because senior members are very good at what they do and are open to mentoring and teaching junior employees and because you are dropped into hard projects and learn how to do advanced things through trial by fire.  People are really smart and passionate about what they do which makes for a great experience as long as you have a good manager. Like all companies, your work is hugely determined by how good your manager is and I've seen some of the best and worst at Uber.  The company takes care of you interms of benefits (food, gym, swag)."
1282,The company is growing very fast and some internal procedures are not perfect yet.,"To be a part of Uber family means to work among super friendly and highly motivated professionals, solving problems nobody faced before."
1283,Haven't been here for too long to be able to see any. So far it's all pros here. :),"The fun in working in Uber is exceptional. It's not like your usual workplace. There is a very big difference compared to other companies I've worked with before. I've been here for only a few months but I don't feel like I don't belong. Every one I work with are really nice people. And the work is also fun. Plus, you get free meals and free rides on top of a high salary.\r\n\r\nBut what I really like the most is that I don't feel like working. I still got a life even when I'm in the office."
1284,"The growth of the company has left some of the data infrastructure struggling to keep up. Our queries can be slow to run sometimes, and sometimes things just fail under the load. But these issues are minor compared to what I love about working here.","I've been at Uber just over three months now, working at the Seattle engineering office. I worked in a very different field before this, so I worried that I'd be behind the curve from day one. Which I was. But working at Uber, I've found that asking questions, challenging assumptions, and being proactive are highly encouraged. I've loved working here - everyday I get to work on incredibly wicked and yet extremely interesting problems."
1285,Long working hours. Required travels from time to time and this maybe not suitable to people who have families.,"Full benefits, place for growing, promotion, recognizing by continuous monitoring and evaluation."
1286,"The location is far from my home.  However, all of the benefits that come with the job make it totally worth the drive.","This work environment is the best that I have ever been a part of.  Uber's culture encourages creativity, individuality, and welcomes diversity.  I feel like I am a valuable part of this organization and I am able to learn new things and expand my responsibilities every day.  I love learning about the company and its mission, and even at an entry level, I am involved in it all.  If I could work here for the rest of my life, I would."
1287,"It's a very fast growing company, requires alert and ready-to-changes mindset","It is an amazingly productive environment, with outstandingly smart people and a world of opportunities. It feels great to have a lot of funding and support from the higher levels, so that the must cutting edge technology can get its way to the market. The best single thing I live everyday is the empowerment of having an impact on the world."

1289,"I'm getting fat, (no worries a gym membership reimbursement is included in the benifits package). The dynamics of this business are a bit much in the beginning so things change daily for everyone, that takes some getting used to, but it is exciting.","#superpumped to be a part of this madness, and to be a part of bringing self driving Ubers to the streets. Best things about working here is there's cutting edge technology EVERYWHERE!!! Excellent coworkers as well, I learn so much from everyone. Also, Snacks, Snacks, Snacks everywhere for everyone all the time! Not to forget about this benefit package they include for everyone that's incredible. I've got such great insurance of all types, unlimited vacation (yes unlimited and paid)! Catered food all the time and per diem when we travel!"
1290,"Plans and schedules change frequently without much notice.  This isn't a problem for me (I actually like how fresh it keeps the job feeling), but I'm sure that this could annoy someone that appreciates stability.  In a way, Uber still acts like a small startup in this respect.","The job has all the amenities that you could want.  Co-workers are nice and helpful, and everyone seems to get along well.  There is flexibility in how you are permitted to get your work done and it doesn't ever seem like anyone is breathing down your neck. Lots of free food and snacks to eat."
1291,"No cons for Uber, everything was well",Loved the  environment and team
1292,The only constant here is change. We are growing so quickly and changing so much that it may be difficult to work here without a malleable schedule.,"The ATC is a passionate, creative and fun work environment. Free (delicious) food and drink. Management is on point and the company truly cares about it's employees. Available benefits packages are inexpensive and widely accepted. Health, dental, vision, life, 401k. Lots of room for advancement. You will love coming to work every day!"
1293,"Policy changes are rather quick and sometimes we get the memo a little late. This isn't as big of an issue as something else I'm going to write a lot about: the shift bid.\r\n\r\nThe shift bid happened before I was a full time employee. Even though we were set to be hired a month after the shift transfer, my class did not get to bid. There were only 9 shifts previously and we moved to an amount of shifts greater than 40. The initial shift assignments were sent out on Wed at 4:55pm. The tool to transfer our shifts between our collegues was not available until Thursday morning at around 11am. This prevented most employees from the beginning of the week (Sun-Wed shifts) from trading with employees on late-week shifts (Wed-Sat). Additionally, the option to transfer ended on Tuesday of the next week. This still prevented late-week shifts from trading with beginning of the week shifts.\r\n\r\nWhen I brought this up to management, they brushed of my concerns by saying that they needed the shifts solidified by Wednesday and that people could just confirm trades from home through their email. However, their second point is invalid as everyone here is EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN from accessing work email at home. \r\n\r\nThis put many people in shifts that did not work for them, including myself. It caused some people with families great turmoil. We have all learned to make it work but it has notably affected both myself and others.","The work culture here is generally amazing! The health insurance coverage is absolutely stellar. We're encouraged to be ourselves and everyone I've known here has been incredibly kind. Being a transgender woman, I was terrified that I'd have to go by my legal male name but I was allowed to select my preferred name in the system immediately. That, combined with the Employee Resource Groups, make this a welcoming and safe place to work for anyone in the LGBT spectrum."
1294,"Poor, vague communication. Not enough clarity about how the job should be done. Direct feedback is either non-existent or avoided by too many of the trainers and managers. The preference seems to be the safety of e-mails or texts rather than in-person conversation, and many trainees agreed that the trainers' communication can't be trusted. Also, the company loves to do things its own way but that led to an elimination of work hours for weeks at a time.",Interesting place to work (their advanced technology center in Pittsburgh). Free meals and snacks during work hours. Good starting salary and benefits.
1295,None to mention so far,"I've been at Uber for about 4 months now and I love it.  The people are great, management is fair, and I haven't had a negative experience yet.  The growth opportunities are great, and people want to help you do that here. I wish everyone could work for Uber.  #Superpumped"
1296,"Definitely some politics, and not so great people who got through the door, however this part of the reality of a high growth company. Some teams, definitely not all, don't have the best work life balance. High pressure environment, comes along with the pro of the company being execution and actionable. There is a fair amount of politics, and people who are \","Uber's business is growing at a tremendous pace, not only is that good for the companies value, but it also provides employees with lot's of opportunity to grow in their careers. The mission of the company is clear, and the leadership is truly committed to the mission. Leadership is committed to the mission of the company, the mission is clear. This is a company of execution and action. Compensation seems fair. They tend to go high on equity and lower on salary, depending on your personal financial situation this could also be a con."

1298,"No annualization, No incentives..I hope that the management will include these in the future","Good compensation,benefits and perks which my previous companies was not able to provide. I love the work environment, not to stressful and bigger chances of earning more"
1299,I have and MBA and 12 years professional experience and this is my professional observation of the company:\r\n-You will be serve the same function as an Uber Partner even though recruiters will tell you that you are going to develop driverless technology.\r\n-All drivers get treated like they are 5 years old even though most of us have advanced degrees  \r\n-Only a small percentage of people actually get to test the technology\r\n-Your primary job will be to taxi employees around and customers who order an UberX.  --You will not have a life if you work here in this job especially if you get the evening shift because you only get a weekend off every 6 weeks.  The schedules are 645a-5p or 445p-3a and once you are on a shift you cannot switch\r\n-You only get a chance to move within the company after 6 months of employment and you must compete with any external candidate who applies directly for the position you want. So if you want a particular position then I highly suggest applying for it directly and DO NOT use the DVO/VO position as a stepping stone because they severely shorthanded with drivers and probably won't let you transfer. \r\n-DO NOT buy into the corporate culture ideals for any project that challenges the status quo no matter how much better it is because if you use them you will be reprimanded.  So if you are a \,Free Parking in the City
1300,Minimal communication\r\nNo room for advancement\r\n\r\nThe managers try their best to care about you but are limited to the support they can provide because of the grip that upper management has on them.  it's like everyone is walking on eggshells at the company.,It was nice to work remotely and they pay training.  At least you can get training and info from other colleagues and sometimes from management.
1301,Can consume your life if you aren't great at work life balance,"Intense environment, but generally happy place to work"
1302,"Politics- doesn't matter how you play it \r\nUnorganized - minimal to no communication, information is either not there or very difficult to find\r\nNo real work recognition",Tight knit team - manager does a very good job at hiring people that fit with the overall team dynamic.
1303,"A lot of people complain about work/life balance, but in my experience it's gotten much much better, even in the last 6 months. \r\n\r\nThere's some disorganization and lack of processes but I think that's because we're growing like crazy.","By any measure, Uber is truly a once-a-decade company. Looking at the growth of the business, the innovation, the leadership, and the quality of your everyday coworkers, it's unlike any place else I've ever worked and I'm loving it.\r\n\r\nSome highlights:\r\n- Every employee is trusted, empowered and given the freedom to drive impact\r\n- Transparency of leadership (as seen in weekly all hands/Q&A with Travis)\r\n- Career opportunities are endless. Do good work and you will be rewarded\r\n- Strong culture where everyone is up to help each other out while all striving towards the same goal of making Uber successful\r\n- Incredibly smart and passionate coworkers"

1305,"Longest hours I've ever worked, still has a start-up feel (not a con), so that is to be expected but with lots of good resources. Still lots of work to be done so while we continue recruiting, this is normal. Feedback given here is not given sugar-coated and can seem aggressive at times.","Work with really smart, passionate people where decisions get made quickly every day. I feel fulfilled doing my job and genuinely happy to go to work every day. Love the flexibility with the company and teams really work together well."
1306,"- Organizational direction changes constantly, Uber seems to have good vision about the long-term mission, but down to specific projects in engineering department chaos is present all over the place\r\n- Politics and internal friction is increasing as company culture somehow encourage aggressiveness, you need to know how to fight for yourself even you are just an engineer.","- Company is still growing fast and has lots of potential in areas like auto-driving cars\r\n- Always new projects to work on, most of time it is hard to decide what to work on next since there are so many choices"

1308,"- Some people expect Uber to be at the same organization level as a Facebook or a Google, but we are still so young and that leads some people to just complain about dumb things about quality of food or lack of process.\r\n\r\n- Some people are here just waiting for an IPO and not because they are passionate about Uber.","- Awesome & supportive team\r\n- Surrounded by smart driven people\r\n- Perks are amazing. Uber credits, free lunches breakfasts, and dinner.\r\n- Not as much politics as you wold expect for a tier 1 engineering company. \r\n- Still feels like a startup, and everyone hustles appropriately."

Everyone is extremely receptive!","The work environment is top notch! I think other companies should take note on how Uber treats their employees. All the great treatment does not go unappreciated either! I think it is directly correlated to the strives we have been making. This is my dream job, and I could not be more thankful!"

Uber is really the only company making a dent in solving last-mile transit problems and many other transportation-related issues. Governments want to solve the problems, but their vision extends only to their borders; Uber has visibility into the problem domain at the world-level. Come make the world a better place."
1321,The job is quite demanding so look for more hours than you are used to unless you do investment banking or busy consulting.,"The job is very challenging, fun, interesting, and different than anything I have ever experienced before. I love working here and working with very smart and determined individuals. The company is really going places and I am glad I can be a part of it."
1322,Super dynamic environment constantly keeps you out of comfort zone:) At times if you are moving too fast small mistake leads to the severe consequences but in Uber you are allowed to make a mistake if you able to learn from them.,Startup environment helps to develop skills much faster.

It is the definitely great place to be!
1323,"It became depressing as an individual committed to the work who was constantly rejected for advancements. I soon found out from a supervisor/mentor that my work was overshadowed by the fact that I didn't have a four year degree. It became hard for me to watch colleagues who put in minimal effort advance over me because they had a 4 year degree from ASU, so I decided to take my experience and find a smaller tech company I could feel valued at.

1326,"Middle management in the corp offices do not have proper oversight over spending, hiring, and personnel management and many put into a management role have no experience in managing staff and it propagates because their manager has no experience managing either. \r\nHR is basically nonexistent. They really only have Recruiters. \r\nGrowth and change is too fast and frequent that it's difficult to get stability. \r\nThere is bias and preferential treatment among some groups.\r\nWork/life balance is a huge struggle, typical of a fast growing company but amplified at Uber 10 fold. \r\nWas the worst work experience of my 25+ career.","Great products; Uber car services, UberEats, etc. A company bringing convenience and filling a need for society. \r\nThe ex-team are visionaries and highly skilled and proven innovators."

I would recommend any passionate software developer to apply here."

1330,"- There aren't a lot of boundaries as far as work/life; e.g. non-urgent requests come through at odd hours and on weekends.\r\n- Unlimited vacation can have the opposite effect when managers and leaders don't model that it's OK to take time off. On the flip side, I see many new dads taking extended parental leave which is awesome.\r\n- I'm not a big fan of the performance review process that leans heavily on subjective feedback.\r\n- The company is still building its development culture and programs.

This company is at the forefront of cutting edge technology, but this technology will never make it to market with inexperienced, improperly educated, lazy, irresponsible hippie management like we have now.",The engineers are brilliant.\nEveryone on the tech side is great to work with.\nThe product is exceptional.\nIt's fun to perform research on a product that's going to be a part of everyday life someday.\nThe company provides generous food and travel accommodations.\nI love the company's mission.  The founders are very inspirational.

1339,Not suited for the ones who don't like changing environments,You get to be an owner and work with the brightest people!
1340,Not a lot of handholding during on-boarding,"Everyone is smart, motivated, and excited about the company's vision. Love it here"
1341,"Personally, I don't and can't disclose where I'm currently working. :( And I can't join contests of Uber such as the Grammy's, UberDUET (even though I don't sing.), etc.","People in Uber are one of the best colleagues one could ever ask. It made me feel at home, even after moving out of my second home of 7 years."
1342,"long work hours like any other startup, nothing bad in particular","Challenging, work among the best people"
1343,It's still in start up mode which requires a lot of time investment from many teams.,Uber is growing at a pace that allows you to have a direct impact on where the company is going. \r\nOne of the cultural values \
1344,"High pressure, high expectations, incredibly talented peer - it can be difficult to stand out, but the collective achievement and shared credit means this isn't actually so bad.","Never have I experienced a company with such ambition to change at pace, with of course the people in place to realize it. It's an inspiring place to come to work every day and there are real efforts to keep the business fresh and steer clear of the pitfalls experienced by corporations of this size."
1345,Give time for the infrastructure to grow and stabilize\r\nLong working hours and no work/life balance\r\nLong working hours,Great people with awesome backgrounds and knowledge\r\nPeople are helpful and want to move fast
1346,Honestly? I'm not sure if I see any right now. Maybe they come with time. Of course there are some stressful days but I can always count on my awesome coworkers to help me.,"People! Driven, open-minded, crazy! It's so nice to work withe them all! It truly couldn't be better.\r\nBesides that: opportunities to grow, great management, all benefits which come with the job - multisport, luxmed, snacks, great biuro etc."
1347,"- Work/life balance could be better, but this is a flip side of a coin of any hyper growth company\r\n- Company in general is doing a pretty bad job in telling its story to the world. Especially, considering how many exciting things there's to tell. This definitely needs a significant improvement",- Super challenging and unique problems\r\n- Hyper-growth company with amazing opportunities to learn and grow
1348,"Long hours sitting in car driving, , make sure  you stretch and take short breaks to decompress the spinal area.","A great job if you like driving and exploring a city. Uber  had a great team of directors, and technicians."
1349,"You will be dealing with ambiguity A LOT. So if you are not comfortable with ambiguity, I don't suggest you to work here at all.",The company is full of elite people and it's definitely somewhere you get the chance to bring real impacts.
1350,I have not experienced negativity so far.,- Surrounded by competent engineers who not only share technical insights but also life advice.\r\n- Task-oriented culture; finish your work and don't stay overnight. (At least in my team).\r\n- The idea that the company is solving a meaningful problem is very genuinely motivating.\r\n- World-class engineering infrastructure and fun environment.
1351,"You want to stay late yourself and it's very easy to do so. Dinner (+beer) is served, towels/showers in the building.",Still has a feel of a growing company within. A lot of young and energetic people.
1352,"I think as elsewhere, the lack of personal time","Future, new technologies, smart and easy life for all, best expirience of my life."
1353,"Since Uber is still growing, products, APIs are still evolving, so their is a lot of work. People work harder here as scale is immense. But trust me, you wont be let down with your super-smart, equally capable colleagues here.","Best company I have worked for. Hands down. \r\n\r\nI had offers from Apple, Google, Next, Oracle. But I am glad I chose Uber. I get to write algorithms here and see them being applied to real world problems. Heard any fancy data structures, yes we write those too. Uber has smartest collections of engineers solving some of the hardest problems. Some of the most cutting-edge solutions that exist are only six months or max one year good enough for Uber scale. Engineers need to design, write and revise their own solution frequently to meet the scale and growth numbers. \r\n\r\nIts super flexible culture. Tired of bay area traffic? No worries, work and come to office on your own terms. Just work smarter and do your job well. \r\n\r\nIt has unlimited vacation policy and many other perks (free gym credits, Uber employee credits, free food). \r\n\r\nIts a highly collaborative and mission driven culture."
1354,Lack of efficiency in certain areas -- it seems like we're constantly taking a few steps back. Career paths can often times be a mystery depending on what org you're in for better and for worse.,Amazing perks and co-workers. Great benefits package.
1355,So far it's hard to find bad things #superpomped maybe beside the time which this job engaging;),This company is still growing exponentially - this is amazing. What's more it's great environment in terms of inspiring people who can learn you a lot. I've got a feeling that everyday I'm learning something different. Love it!
1356,"It's a lot of work, but what startup isn't? No one really watches the clock so it's still easy to have a flexible schedule. Sometimes I have to hop on my computer in the evenings and on the weekends, but I can do that from home.","- work on things that have never been done before\r\n- learn from the best in the industry\r\n- the company is literally changing the world\r\n- very little red tape for career growth: easy to get promoted\r\n- small teams, high impact\r\n- Uber credits, free catered meals and snacks, unlimited PTO, great health insurance"
1357,More equity based than cash. Work life balance can be tough. Fast growth means a lot of growing pains -- not all the leaders are as mature.,"Great, intelligent, people. Passionate about their work. Many passionate about product and where we're headed. Some decent perks for the tech world."
1358,Salary is at the very bottom range of the skill set and market rates for the competence that people have here.,"Sharp, humble colleagues, great work environment, very proactive and ever changing career and responsibilities, great opportunities to grow and evolve and work abroad."
1359,Poor career growth at times,Energetic and happening work environment
1360,Too good to be true :),- Working with best professionals\r\n- Company grows really fast\r\n- The best place to show your ownership\r\n- It feels more like entrepeneur experience than working for a big company
1361,"I dislike that most of my career moves over the last 2 years have been lateral. I also find myself torn between making a decision that the data supports, versus making a decision that feels right (e.g. price cuts). Overall I feel confident in what we do, I just wish we put more heart and empathy into it.","I've been at Uber for over 2 years now, I definitely love the environment and feel like I work on meaningful, impactful projects. I'm also surrounded by some of the smartest people I've interacted with, and am constantly inspired by them every day."
1362,Even the management has less powers to get some work done. (Ex: Setting up a new office),The environment is friendly and the organization culture is great for a beginner. The pay is above average even for an executive position.The executives also have relevant authority to make decisions with regards to the given situations. Great support from other employees. A great platform not only to work but to learn too.
1363,You need to learn how to manage your work/life balance because sometimes you get super excited about what you are doing at work.,"Uber encourage your projects, make you feel comfortable of the big beats you need to make to achieve your goals and you really make life of the people better at your job. It's a great place to work and to improve your skills. Innovation is a daily challenge for your duties, your co-workers are so highly qualified that make you improve your skills all the time. Great facilities and an excellent workplace are also part of this job. Team work and optimistic leadership is required in order to beat the challenges of changing the way policy makers thinks about the tech companies and the transportation challenges."
1364,Difficult to focus on priorities since there are too many things going on at the same time.,Super interesting work. People are super motivated and work really hard. Very hands on. You are promoted to take initiative and solve problems very fast. \r\nI have  been incredibly impressed by the level of knowledge sharing inside the company. The  company is super global and chances are that somebody else in another part of the world is already working in a similar initiative; within minutes you can connect and jump in call with an expert on the topic - super collaborative environment.
1365,Want to see Uber in China again,Love this company's culture. Hope to work for Uber again~ T_T
1366,"As with most fast growing companies, it can get a little messy. Processes are still being set and updated. But if you are quick on your feet, constantly communicating with people and open to changes, you'll do fine.","You are constantly surrounded by intelligent, driven, straight-talking yet lovely and highly-motivated people that will challenge you everyday to do better. It can get overwhelming at times but instead of feeling drained, you are actually more inspired to go in everyday and level up."
1367,My commute is not so good and Uber credits don't really cover the fare.\r\nFood isn't great :(,A bunch of very smart people. \r\nVery approachable senior people on the team.\r\nWork life balance is really respected.\r\nReady to learn from mistakes in the past ( I'm part of core infrastructure group and not everything that was done in past was right. people accept the mistake and are eager to learn from it )\r\nSuperpumpedness everywhere
1368,-Still very 'start up' in feel due to the nature of the company having localised offices (is also a pro) \r\n- Can feel disorganised at times,- Working with some of the smartest people in the world on exciting ideas and problems\r\n- Happy working environment\r\n- People are passionate about what they do\r\n- Fast paced company
1369,No work life balance which makes in challenging in the long term.,Great place to work with very smart people and always changing environment
1370,the salary here is not very fair.,It is quite free to work here.and the environment here is quite good.
1371,"There is no real leadership. Managers are only there to analyze data. Representatives have no leadership, and no advocacy.","Start-up culture, so lunch is provided along with snacks and drinks."
1372,"In the few first weeks, you will be burn out as you don't know how to react to the speed of company.",everyday You need to be super-active in the hurricane. If your want an active environment. This is definitely a place you need to join. You will feel 1 week is just  a blink.
1373,No set schedule or hours. Not direct person you can call for questions. Everything is online. Training absolutely sucks! It's all done via an online group conference and you learn absolutely nothing. You are basically thrown to the wolves. Pay system sucks as well. All pay is done through a temp agency and if you forget to log in your hours on sunday you don't get paid.,Hourly pay. You get to sit at a desk.
1374,The day to day operations seem to get really repitive.,The work atmosphere was extremely laid back and enjoyable
1375,"Lots of rush, constant change, long hours, but its definitely worth your effort and time","Environment! This is a great place to work, people will help you ALL THE TIME! You will not get a no when it comes to assistance and support\r\nThis company is for real, they take your word, they listen to you, they see the value in you."
1376,"This isn't really a con, but there's definitely a learning curve when you come onboard. Like most startups, Uber has its own language and way of doing things. Patience and a solid sense of \","Working at Uber is challenging, engaging, and - most importantly - incredibly fun. Both my direct teammates and colleagues across other departments are intelligent, driven, and passionate about the work that they're doing, which makes all the difference in an environment where hustling is valued above all else. There's an incredible willingness to share knowledge and support, as everyone is working towards the same end goal of making Uber a continued success."
1377,Long hours and not much downtime. Management have favourites and there is not much transparency in the company.,"Free lunch, great colleagues and central location."
1378,"The fast pace might not be comfortable for everyone, you need to be ready to handle everything on the fly and multitask pretty seriously","Extremely fast-paced environment, amazing culture, very smart people around every corner. It's a great feeling to work with people that very driven and passionate about everything they do"
1379,"- I have had a great experience working for Uber, but I believe it has largely to do with what team you are on. My manager and lead are very compassionate people who are invested in how I grow as a designer. Make sure your manager/lead are people you would like to work with and learn from during your interview. Makes all the difference!\r\n\r\n- I have a really long commute. Would like if there were better commuter benefits","- Very transparent company. Weekly all-hands keep me informed of what all the other product teams are working on. TK (CEO) also does weekly Q&A and is very honest, so I always have a good sense of what direction the company is going, or I can find out\r\n\r\n- Extremely passionate people who love their craft and are experts in their own field. Very inspiring to be surrounded by these type of people\r\n\r\n- So many resources... makes it easier to do your job and be confident about your work!\r\n\r\n- BEST Pro: The things I work on actually go into production.

1380,"As Uber is still in its startup phase, processes are constantly changing and not everyone is aligned all the time internationally, so working with different cities can be a little challenging. But it will get better as we continue growing.","Working with self-motivated individuals that come together for a greater purpose. Everyone you meet will amaze you with their knowledge and it's crazy how 95% of the time, you'd be friends with them outside of work."
1381,"-Pay. People almost always take a base salary cut to join, but make it up in equity granted. Only trouble is we don't know when that equity will be worth anything \r\n-Not a ton of transparency when it comes to company changes and leadership restructuring \r\n-Uncertainty. Recent A-team departures make the rest of us start doubting if everything is OK at the helm\r\n-Not a ton of concentration on diversity or inclusion. Salaries differ greatly among coworkers with the same title in order to stay competitive.",-Exciting work in a fast-paced company - there's definitely a \
1382,"There's a strong expectation that everyone here will support and identify with the company's mission. If you think Uber is making the world a better place -- or if you're just super-enthusiastic to work on our meaty data science, engineering, UX, and operational challenges -- this is a plus. But if you're not into it, this won't be a great place to work.\r\n\r\nA lot of our compensation (and nearly all of our annual bonus) is in equity. Your recruiter will try to give you an estimate of what your shares will be worth, but it's the same as equity in any other startup -- it's a lottery ticket. That said, the salary is still fair.","Lots of room to take on new responsibilities, get involved with exciting new projects, and help others succeed. You're encouraged to \"
1383,"The main cons would be worklLife balance - lots of weekends, late nights and after hours.","Fast paced, exciting company. Lots of personal development opportunities. Super exciting campaigns, on-demands, events, partnerships."
1384,Working hours are somewhat \,"Inspiring workplace, plenty of possibilities, incredible growth and unbelievable atmosphere. Every employee here feels valuable and respected, not to mention the perfect work environment."
1385,High ambitions translate into high expectations and the productivity bar is high. There's flexibility in working hours but still a predominant American business culture that needs to open up to cultural differences.,"Amazing peers, highly motivated and ambitious. Inspiring challenges and problems to solve will keep you constantly on your toes. Innovation is valued, decisions are taken quick and the learning curve is steep. There's a great amount of change needed to scale the business and support the company's growth in all fronts and you will be able to build and contribute to it."
1386,"Work-life balance, and stress in the work place",A lot of very smart people working at an extremely fast pace. The company has amazing focus on where it wants to go
1387,Too many young individuals - hence lacking the proper direction\r\nCut-throat environment - employees \,Plenty of things to learn due to the start-up culture\r\nLots of room to roam around to experiment\r\nProgressive environment\r\nGood support from HQ\r\nEquities!
1388,"Be ready to hustle at all times. The rhythm at which the company is growing and the pace at which it changes is unbelievably fast, so no challenge or day at the office will ever be the same as the previous one.","Absolutely everyone at Uber is a highly competent and intelligent person. Everyone is focused at all times trying to figure out how to make things happen, rather than just meeting a schedule and \"
1389,"- Need a better reward policies to make sure employees are also focused on long-term impact.\r\n- If you're not mature enough, do not join.","- Cultural values are practical and solution oriented\r\n- Everyone is encouraged to be aggressive\r\n- Hands off environment where no one tells you what to work on. You tell a story of why your work is impactful, and whoever delivers most impact rises."
1390,Long hours are expected and many people complain that their base salaries would be higher at other firms. Overall it's all worth it!,"Benefits, Free Meals, Dynamic/Fast Paces work environment, Very young and ambitious workforce. The perks are also excellent!"
1391,"- The business is everything.  Some employees had to work 80-hour weeks for months because their team was given a very aggressive deadline.  Other teams were still working 40-hour weeks.  It seems like some engineers should have been pulled from other teams to help out the ones in a crunch.\r\n- The vibe I get is that I would be in deep trouble if I said something offensive.  The atmosphere isn't especially playful.\r\n- No 401k matching.\r\n- Very real risk of there never being an IPO if the China effort isn't successful.  Everyone at the company is gambling that Uber will do well in its segment of the market.  I believe in the company, but it's still scary.  Few at Google or Facebook are worried about their company's future.\r\n- Unlimited vacation depends on the team.  Unlimited is obviously a misnomer.  Vacation has to be approved by the manager, only employees have to figure out how much is the right amount.  With a defined policy, employees could use all their vacation with the confidence they're not taking too much.  That said, people do take vacation and are fully unplugged while they're out.","Before interviewing and joining, I had the impression from media coverage that Uber was kind of an amoral company full of brogrammers.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  People at Uber care a LOT about their communities.  Hiring is the most diverse out of any company I've ever worked at.  C-level executives emphasize during the all-hands that they don't tolerate insensitive comments or behavior.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Lots of smart people; this can be intimidating but it means there's lots of opportunity to learn.\r\n- Great work, high impact.  Even interns get important projects.\r\n- Professional demeanor.  I don't see anyone playing political or social games.  \"
1392,They tell you that if you do a good job you will move up in the company that isn't totally true there are some hard working people their that don't get noticed and taken for granted. Though the benefits are great it doesn't help pay for the bills and get you too and from work. The Uber Credits come out of your check if you have to use them a lot to get to work.,"Good and fun people to work with everyday. Great benefits including free food, great health insurance and Uber Credits for all the platforms."
1393,"Not all markets receive attention equilly (China, India, etc. have more priority, incl. local product team resources), uncertain career path (good to have flat structure but don't know where the road will take me in 1-2 years).","Flat org structure, tons of projects to get your hands on, supportive and inspiring managers, still ground-zero opportunity in which you can contribute on a daily-basis, experiment and immediately see the result of your effort."
1394,"The company is growing fast, which means embracing a little chaos. \r\n\r\nPeople work hard, and there's a huge amount to do. This means you learn an enormous amount, but also that we all need to make sure we take personal time to decompress.","Incredible colleagues - some of the brightest people I've ever met. Before joining I was a little nervous about the company's culture, but the external perception is far from the truth. While hard-working and rewarding 'hustle', there's a friendly, intellectually curious, thoughtful vibe throughout. \r\n\r\nThe people are international in background and outlook, and it's a fun office environment.\r\n\r\nYou get to work on big problems, often ones that haven't been tackled before. And feel like you're having an impact on cities, and the lives of riders and drivers.\r\n\r\nThere's v little bureaucracy (although it's slowly growing), and lots of scope to just get stuff done."

1405,"I was poached from a very prestigious company...and promised a bright future at Uber as one of the original remote CSR hires. Unfortunately that turned into a contract with ZeroChaos instead which I voluntarily ended after months of no guidance, no leadership, no structured approach to support. Scheduling was a continual nightmare, rather than the flexibility that was promised. Overall disaster.","-Remote work\r\n-Decent pay\r\n-Freedom to solve issues for community and partners as you saw fit, but this lack of structure and guidance led to issues as the company scaled"
1406,"Where to begin...Uber is basically Game of Thrones translated into SV workplace.\r\n\r\nNo company churns as much as Uber, even at 7,000 employees - the amount of chaos is unnecessary and exhausting, due to inexperienced management and ingrained top-down aggressive culture.\r\n\r\nAggressive jerks and huge self-serving egos are not only tolerated, they are rewarded. You will be instructed to ignore other teams and duplicate effort to reach your goals, regardless of overall value to the company. You will be cursed at, and public ridicule is not punished. Everyone who lasts has sharp elbows and uses them. Many pieces of the Product team are brutally political, with a churn/burn mindset to people. This contributes to a noticeable lack of diversity in gender, race, age, etc. If you don't fit the model of a ex-Google/Facebook late-20's male employee, you won't fit in. Experienced, high-functioning, hard-working and well-liked co-workers \","Uber is a fascinating business model, and the international scope, fast growth and leading market position are addicting for business-case junkies.\r\n\r\nMany Co-workers are smart and hard-working if somewhat dull (but at huge cost - see below)\r\n\"
1407,"work out of remote locations, no physical office, no benefits, lots of driving","Fast paced, always changing, brand new equipment, computers, resources."
1408,"Uber is a rapidly growing company, and as a result, the onboarding process could be streamlined a bit more. But otherwise, I don't have any complaints!","Working at Uber has been, by far, the best move I've made for my career. The work environment is fast-paced, and each employee (engineer, designer, data scientist, etc.) moves quickly and efficiently to meet their goals. Everyone holds themselves and each other to a high standard, and this creates a culture of passion, commitment, and most importantly, collaboration. Uber's driven employees paired with the noble mission of making transportation as reliable as running water makes for an incredible work experience, and I'd highly recommend software engineers (among other roles) to apply."
1409,"The CEO is a moron. The company has lost close to $2 billion in 2016 thus far, and this is after selling off their interests in China. They are going under.","There were a lot of smart, motivated people there. Free food."
1410,Senior leadership does not seem to truly value employees (or drivers). People are viewed as expendable. This will ultimately hurt the business if they don't make changes. Not one cultural value about people.,"Smart people, eager to solve problems, hard working, great business idea. People are willing to work on big challenges and don't give up."
1411,No path to permanent employment.  Forever temp position (at the time at least).  Invasive security policy (They want the rights to complete access to your personal equipment used to do the job)  Really disorganized.,Casual atmosphere.  Discount on service.  Relatively high hourly for work at home.
1412,Managers had a full plate so you had to figure a lot of stuff out on your own. Not necessarily very organized yet by the time I left the company. Did not compensate contractors well even though we contributed a lot to the company.,"The company was still at an early stage, so there was a lot of room for me to figure out what I wanted to do within the company and took initiative to be in charge of the role I wanted."

1414,Diversity issues and the worst attendance policy I ever heard of and the lack of mobility to move up in the company.,"Great benefits and healthcare, but pay is below average for the work that you do. You get free lunch and snacks, major perk."
1415,I have no cons at this time.,"Uber is an inspiring, mission driven, team oriented company to work for.  I wake up every day super pumped to go to work."
1416,I found that the managers within certain HQ teams encouraged and supported a \,If you're a millennial Uber is the place for you...The potential for growth is exponential. Find a mentor and visionary that will help guide you through process. There are many available within cross functional teams. Its about knowing who is supportive and who has their own agenda.

1419,"Premature startup with refreshingly little change control and process, but this lends to some disorganization and disconnect between departments.  Somewhat of a popularity contest advancing in the company.  Very long hours frequently, and co-workers look down on others that don't put in extra time.","Great environment, good salaries/hourly rates, wonderful perks, very good and open-minded employees, challenging and innovative work always."
1420,"Uber is constitutionally incapable of being a high-quality software outfit. As an organization, it's addicted to shipping, and the recent push to increase software reliability is doomed to failure in the face of the fact that the people tasked with implementing it are either 1) the aforementioned SHIP IT junkies or 2) hastily-hired junior developers (you get to learning their names pretty quick when you correlate them with the most totally indefensible outages). A lot of compensation and perks policies are plainly insulting -- e.g. the deadline for exercising options after termination (I don't know if I can't share it, so just imagine a big middle finger directed at everyone who doesn't have the capital to not bankrupt themselves with AMT costs), or the new free rides structure -- and they all point to the fact that Uber doesn't need you and doesn't care. The contrast between that fact and the generally high levels of Kool-Aid flowing around at all times is probably unhealthy to endure for anyone with even a modicum of self-respect. It's pretty hard to have a sense of career trajectory when you get a new manager every few months (seriously, it's like Omaha Beach at the manager level, they'll probably be erecting a memorial in the lobby at HQ pretty soon). I'm not self-important enough to believe that any of this will necessarily have any external business effect -- they seem to be trucking along just fine -- but it's not a satisfying place to be an engineer (except possibly front-end -- they seem to have a better sense of polish and professionalism than other parts of the org). I'm glad the various ERGs exist, but they're not a substitute for actual resources being devoted to improving hiring and culture by management.","If you end up in the right place, there's latitude to work on pretty far-ranging projects, and you if really end up in the right place, they won't be rush jobs. New engineering leadership seems to have a solid vision. There are some very impressive people here, though it's telling that I'd describe none of them as matching the dominant demographics or culture here."
1421,"Uber is an extremely frustrating place to work (The honeymoon period wears off pretty quickly). The company has the money and the brand to attract the best in terms of engineering but for whatever reason the product and engineering orgs leave so much to be desired (and I am not even in engineering!)

Both riders and drivers are lured to systems by promotions, incentives and credits, particularly true in countries supported company's hyped growth\r\n- Drivers are paid barely higher than minimum wage given the gas and car ownership cost, large percent drivers leave the platform after a few weeks or months. Constant high cost to recruit new drivers.\r\n- Increasing competition from not only tech companies, but also car manufactures, taxi companies.\r\n\r\nThe model may work when autonomous car on road, which eliminates drivers from the ecosystem. At the same time, it will make every car manufacture a competitor. Tesla, VW, Toyota, Audi, GM etc will join Apple, Google, Amazon to fight for market share.  The winner would be a tech savvy car maker or a joint venture from a tech giant and car maker. Making autonomous car is a bigger challenge than building a ride sharing platform.\r\n\r\nCar is commodity, but autonomous car is true innovation.  Ride sharing platform is less complicated than many high traffic systems today, the realtime dispatch component is likely be the trickiest, which heavily relies on map and realtime traffic report. \r\n\r\nMap developer owns the most important ride sharing static (map) and dynamic data (realtime traffic), will eventually rule the ride sharing platform.\r\n\r\nUber is ambitious and chose to work on everything in house including autonomous car, map.

Because most people in the Amsterdam office are not from the Netherlands and therefore do not have a giant social crew outside the office when starting, there is plenty of social stuff going on throughout the week.

Uber demands hard work from everyone and consistent 8-hr days are rare.,"I came to Uber concerned about rumors I had heard about a cutthroat culture.  I needn't have worried.  Uber is one of the most collaborative environments I have ever worked in.  Whether its answering a question about their code, helping to debug, or working together on a feature, people have been uniformly enthusiastic about helping their co-workers.  Perhaps this is because everyone's stock grants are so large that people just want the company to succeed :-)\r\n\r\nUber is good at pruning out busy-work.  Everyone I know is working on a project that I characterize as 'critical'.  \r\n\r\nThe quality of the engineering team is excellent.

Really energetic colleagues who are passionate about making a difference."
1468,"Where to start.  At the beginning the passion was dripping from every corner because of the idea that this company was trying to fix a broken system (transportation, logistics).  That lasted a couple of months. Uber is in all purposes smoke and mirrors. For example all these posts that your reading.  Guess what, they are all lies.  Uber created them. How do I know?  That was our job, to manufacture fake reviews.  We had other duties but was told to fit this task between projects.  Why do you think my former CEO has a 91% approval rating.  It's laughable.  It should be near 40% and that's being generous. Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Virginia Rometty, those are great CEO's.  Travis Kalanick, Jeff Bezos, the late Steve Jobs.  These indivisuals exploit thier most common resourse, the worker.  All they care about is the bottom line. Its all about the money.  I cant't be part of such a reckless, immature, self centered company.  I wouldn't even be a customer.  Why would I want any of my hard earned money to go into the pockets of a handful of careless individuals.  Because trust me when I tell you that the drivers and my former colleagues do not get compensated very well.  The drivers actually net zero profit for what they have to endure.  Ever wonder why it cost $9 to go to the airport. Of course you dont because its cheap.  Well you should because that driver is probably only making a $1.25 profit off that trip.  We are all in this together. We shouldn't be taking advantage of others. But this is our society.  Pay $12 for a drink but God forbid your commute home is more the $5.",Staff is hungry and energetic. New realm of possibilities.  Not to many pros besides those.  Sorry GlassDoor.  Hard to make this part at least 20 words.

All the teams work together and seek for solutions and they work on this not just because it is their job duty, but they are all passionate to make the world moving.

Results matter (almost to a fault), face time is meaningless.\r\n\r\nI think the equity I was hired with will be worth many multiples in a very short time.  I feel like an owner."
1476,At times the atmosphere is quite competitive although the company preaches togetherness. That same competitive nature can make for a toxic environment when based on merit that is proven by boasting and not actual ability or accomplishment. \r\n\r\nWork/ life balance is almost nonexistent which can lead to high stress levels.,"There's never a dull moment in this fast paced environment. If you are a fan of innovation and can handle unexpected change, this is the place for you. Be prepared to pull up your boot straps and dig in."
1477,"As a white girl, I never thought about diversity before UBER, however, at this job it was impossible to ignore the lack of it.\r\n\r\n- Majority of drivers were from a diverse range of minority groups that you can find in NYC, that's expected, anyone that understand the driver landscape in NYC will know this. However, the entire office in Manhattan is white. This created a very strange dynamic, in a already tense environment. \r\n\r\n- Many of the drivers had limited english, insecure about their technology knowledge and some  would have preferred to not join UBER, but felt they were forced because of UBER's take over of the market. The demographics in the office intensified all of the factors mentioned above.\r\n\r\n- The managers seem to think, that successful driver retention is based on how much money the drivers can make, however, after spending so much time with them, I realized the majority of them also care as much about belonging to something.\r\n\r\n- Many of the drivers also explicitly expressed discomfort with the demographics of the office, we have to remember that the industry was very much controlled by a diverse group of immigrants prior to UBER, so for the drivers to enter a driver support center that is all white, was uncomfortable and makes no business sense. One driver even once told me \","I was working as Partner Support Representative for a few months, I decided not to extend my contract, however, I loved working with the drivers and supporting them with on-boarding.

You'll notice that it applies to this position as well. Your sick days, personal days, and vacation days are all combined into one insufficient balance throughout the year.

For the most part, the people that share the same status as you are enjoyable to be around and can be there for help whenever you need it. \r\n\r\nIn regards to perks, you can expect to dress casual everyday, have access to a limited snack selection, and eat a catered lunch/dinner daily (which I personally don't recommend, but some do!). As full time employees, you'll most likely receive some type of pre-tax compensation to use for Uber's products in app as well."
1484,Quantity more important than quality - friends make jokes about the number of Uber app updates for bug fixes. Work environment. Travel arrangements-roommates? Nasty review system. Poor treatment of contract employees. Huge turnover.,Decent pay. Ability to learn new technologies on company time. Quantity more important than quality. Lots of super-smart and industrious coworkers.
1485,"less time for social life, long hours","Fast paced, dynamic, enthusiastic, creative, cultural"
1486,Communication was minimal from the top and continued to weaken as messages passed down from upper levels to lower levels of employee clearance. As a young organization whose goal has been to redefine a longstanding industry (which it has successfully done!) the company still has a lot to learn in terms of positive vs. negative \,"Great coworkers in an overall low pressure, laid back atmosphere. Being a part of a company that has become such a big part of current pop culture was an interesting and exciting experience -- high \"
1487,"Marketing give so much opportunity & problem both helpful,  problems give experience to me & this experience is opportunity in future",I can manage about clients & any kind of challenging work. that 's why I am interested about this job
1488,The hours are definitely long and expectations are high but this culture allows the small teams to achieve big things,"I work amazing people who work hard to solve really difficult problems\r\nI learn loads every day, the pace is very fast!\r\nI'm empowered to take ownership of problems and solve them day to day as well as with longer projects.\r\nNo problem at Uber is ever too big to be solved"
1489,"It is slowly turning in a large enterprise, it has more than 6000 employees now so if you're looking for a startup environment it's not the place to go.",The company is dynamic and growing really fast.\r\nThere are business travels occurring often.\r\nPeople are very energetic and smart.
1490,You did a lot better working with their system if you have a Mac than if you had any other type of operating system.,It was fun working remotely for Uber while they were setting up their rider and driver email contact system. Things changed a lot but our manager did his best to keep us updated.
1491,"Uber is and will be for a while in the hyper growth phase - not everything is super organized during this phased. It asks you to be an entrepreneur, go hustle, take on problems and own them. Not everyone likes that approach.","High velocity stimulating environment. You want to get things done, you can get things done! If Google is the company that defined information intent (enabled by technology), Facebook was the company than enabled social intent, Uber is the company that solves physical intent, which is the strongest intent one might argue."
1492,- Very limited growth opportunities\r\n- Culture\r\n- Underpaid employees,- Lots of perks\r\n- Good benefits\r\n- Amazing people\r\n- Company events
1493,"Leadership lacks empathy (those that do are let go / leave) and expects hiring fast, firing slow. Amazon but worse - plenty of back-channeling, finger pointing, arguments, intimidation. Survival of the fittest with clear fight or flight mentality across the board. Core Values of toe-stepping, principled confrontation, hustle, winning (among others) that promote individualistic ideas vs. teamwork. Makes getting things done difficult. \r\n\r\nAbsolute culture of censorship, lack of perception to outside world. Those who speak the loudest win and continue to be promoted. Unlimited vacation is moot, expect to be working all hours, all days, all vacations. \r\n\r\nExpect to be cussed at.","There is an incredible amount to work to be done, as is normal at any startup (even one growing as quickly as Uber), plenty of challenging, hard, and engaging problems to solve. People who join are for the most part passionate about the product/future forward looking aspect of the company, while also incredibly smart. \r\n\r\nUber will also teach you nothing you've experienced before at any other job and everything you'll need to prepare you for your next role when you leave.  \r\n\r\nHowever, all this comes at an egregious cost (below):"
1494,Very busy all the time.,Relax Atmosphere\r\nFriendly team \r\nOpen for discussion environment \r\nFace to face discussions
1495,Lots of hard work and long hours make your work/life balance a little tough but its worth it!,Working with so many highly motivated and ambitious people is awesome. They offer great little perks and are very loyal to their employees. If you are willing to work hard and are looking for a company to build a career with - Uber is for you!
1496,"All the pros mentioned above are old story. The food quality has gone from bad to worse and it's not even edible anymore. Uber has hired people left, right and center. Managers hire people from their previous companies, either peers or reports, so that they have people to support them. Almost all the managers and higher management guys are super selfish and arrogant. NOBODY thinks about advancing their reports and taking their team together with them. This is what happens when you hire people who have never managed a single person or people who already have a bad reputation at their previous companies and to them, joining Uber seemed a great way to start from a clean slate. Employees are being fed BS by their managers when they ask questions. Loads of politics has just crept into everything and the work culture here sucks. It will not be surprising if they find their talented engineers looking for opportunities outside the company. It's not the same anymore. I really hoped this was it for me, but apparently it's not.","When I joined a year back, there were quality people with a mission. There was excitement in the work. People who did well got the praises on their own without politics playing any role in it.\r\nFree food and drinks all throughout the day."
1497,There's not actually  beside it's very difficult to know what's going on in a big company like Uber.,"Meet lof people, if you do like helping people that the great job for you."
1498,Well food might not be that good as those provided in some specific companies LOL,"1. Free to talk, free to pickup challenges, free to work on what you liked.\r\n2. Fully trusted by other guys and the manager, have a word to say about products that's been worked on.\r\n3. I always come to the office at 11:00 ;)\r\n4. Cooperative colleges. Everyone is eager to help others out, passionate on all-win."
1499,"No benefits, not a full time gig","Good hours, fun people, changing enviornmet"
1500,"The pace and hard work required is not for everyone. I work as hard as when I ran my own company, and everyone needs to have that level of dedication to make things successful here. At this stage of growth, it really does take a lot of time because there is a lot of work to do. \r\n\r\nThings are more organized that one might expect at this stage of startup hyper growth. So there is probably more structure than some people might like if they want a true early-stage startup environment. We are growing fast but also maturing fast.","Incredibly smart and talent people paired with a very strong work ethic. People at Uber seem to truly absorb the company value on ownership (Be an owner, not a renter) and put in the time and effort needed to do the job right. There is a lot of work to do, but it's not easy building the fastest-growing company ever. \r\n\r\nIt's wonderful being part of a team moving at light speed. As a recruiter, it's great to be able to help the best people on the planet find roles at Uber they can really make a difference in. Management from CEO down are also extremely involved and supportive of the recruiting function, which is a great feeling."
1501,"The role extends well beyond what is outlined, long hours, lean teams mean you end of getting stretched super thin and feeling overworked","Tons of agency and independence, huge learning opportunities, part of something really impactful,"

1507,I'm planning compensation should be more,Benefits management and Co wielders are great
1508,Training does not fully prepare you for your job. Managers are mostly not in touch with their teams. Often feels like you are on your own to figure everything out.,Work from home. Fairly flexible schedules. Lots of great remote coworkers to connect with.
1509,"Everyone you meet will not tell you their opinion about Uber, whether they love it or hate it, or have a story about one random trip their third cousin took years ago. It is like being a dentist and everyone showing you they teeth. \r\n\r\nThe amount of work and commitment you have leaves little room for free hours for your extracurriculars.","You can really see the impact of the work you do and the impact is moving people around cities and better transportation for everyone. \r\nIt is not everywhere that all the people you work with and inspiring! There are so many different background but everyone has a special something that makes them awesome! Everyone works hard to find the best and creative solutions. Your team is really the best way to learn and be inspired at your work. \r\nNo micromanagement, you get to design, run and track the projects you work on, with feedback and help from your team if you every need it. \r\nThe company treats you so well, they are really just worried about you loving Uber and doing the best you can."
1510,Have to be able to deal with uncertainty.,"Love the people, pace, environment. It's a hectic place to work and definitely not for everyone, but if you are smart, make good decisions and love just getting it done, it's a great place to work."
1511,- You will need to be very self organized due to the fast pace\r\n- You will need to be able to hit the ground running and have a perspective on the problems you're tackling right out the gate.,"- Working on projects that have (actual) global impact\r\n- Incredible team with a diverse set of skills and backgrounds\r\n- Intelligent overlap between data, design, and engineering\r\n- Thoughtful and passionate leadership"
1512,- You work a lot (no work-life balance)\r\n- Constant stress\r\n- No medical insurance,- The fastest growing company in the world\r\n- The ownership you get while executing your tasks and goals\r\n- Working with the top minds and the best calibers in the world
1513,Constantly changing the payment structure. Very unorganized. Lack of support from admin.,Flexible schedule. I enjoyed helping people sign up to become drivers.

1515,"The only thing we find difficult with Uber is when we run out of ideas. We think of the most creative and logical ideas, and it's so frustrating when you have thought of almost everything.",The culture. Nothing beats the culture within Uber. You will seriously know how it feels to work with best of the best.
1516,Very long hours. Any one considering any position at Uber must be aware of the long hours which can sometime affect the work life balance. A large degree of this is compensated for through an outstanding company culture.,Fast paced environment with incredible people from a wide range of backgrounds. Huge opportunities for learning.
1517,"Because Uber is a startup, patience with the company is in order...but it's worth it in the long run.","Honest, fast paced company. Never a dull moment and always learning!"
1518,- Lots of great ideas leads us to perhaps take on too many projects as once,- Amazing and caring co-workers\r\n- Bold and extremely impactful mission \r\n- Great place to put your skills to the test in a fast-paced environment that challenges everyone
1519,"When people say you work a lot you really do here. However I would rather much say this place is all about hustle which is how much do you really want it. Even though I have slotted this under as a con, you might feel as if this is the type of environment you want to be a part of.","The company at a whole is a fast pace, creative, and high potential company to be a part of. Everyday you see new products being created to tackle some of the biggest problems in the world. It's hard to deny the talent that this company attracts and the best part is a company like this, comes once in a lifetime."
1520,Long hours (but I'd say comparable to other tech/startups and other jobs). The job is what you make it- you hit the ground running and expectations are high!,You'll meet some of the most driven and ambitious people here. Really exciting company with lots of new things going on all the time. Plenty of opportunities to get involved! Overall just inspiring company trying to change transportation!
1521,Little to no work life balance. Expected to be connected all of the time. Some leadership thinks you need to stay at the office late to be working. Not a lot of upward movement outside of HQ in San Francisco.,"Smart people doing meaningful and fulfilling work. Good perks, lots of opportunities - including abroad. Strong leadership, good stock options."
1522,"Work life balance can get a little crazy. I have spent a few late nights at the office (latest was 4am one night). While the management encourages to get a good amount of sleep each night, they also stress for employees to find their \","Everyone is extremely intelligent, passionate, and hard working. I'm learning new skills every day that I will be able to use in the future, and pushing myself by being surrounded by talented individuals. People are always willing to help you if you have any questions. Everyone is friendly and fun, and you really feel appreciated. Because it's in a hyper-growth phase right now, there is always more to do and work on. There are tons of interesting engineering problems related to scaling right now that are very unique to Uber. Being a part of that is very exciting to me."
1523,"Unlimited vacation days are offered as a benefit, but looked down on when you take them.\r\n\r\nThe wrong people are placed in management roles.\r\n\r\nThe company doesn't actually care about their people. Management promises one thing, and turns around and does something completely different. Their excuse is always \","Fun, fast-paced company\r\n\r\nWork with incredibly smart people\r\n\r\nFree food!"
1524,The repetitiveness can take its toll with some long days. Keeping motivated on a daily basis can be a challenge some days.,"Makes you feel like you are part of the team, you can actually see that everything is growing around you. This makes you feel invested in what you are doing to help the company."
1525,"Uber is an aggressive company - all that matters is results, no matter how you get there. Work 70 hours, step on toes, doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThere is NO training. If you're new, you have to figure everything out, and if you mess up, you get blamed. There is a common practice of firing people after 2 months if they can't figure things out or keep up. They do NOT give any warnings or feedback, even if you ask for it. Work-life balance is non-existent.\r\n\r\nI saw 3 people get fired after 2 months for \",Everyone is super smart and things get done very quickly.
1526,"Late hours, a lot of things to do might be a problem to people with families.","Uber gives incredible opportunity to grow so rapidly and in so many ways, there is no other place to compare it with. Incredible, fast paced environment where everything changes before you get use to it. Senior Management shares vision with entire team giving everyone place to improve life of the whole company."
1527,Base salaries are pretty less compared to most big companies (because its a pre IPO company),"Great culture (of course based on team), but I don't see much difference in how teams operate.\r\nNo managerial crap like big companies (even though Uber has grown out of being a startup)\r\nThings move really fast, if you used to working in big companies on your own pace and chilled out environment, Uber might end up being your nightmare.\r\nHigher management is very good and know what they are doing and have better planning for future of the company."
1528,"Super aggressive culture, not diverse, many executives lacking basic social graces, hiring too fast has resulted in lower caliber of employees in some parts of company",The smart people at Uber are the *smartest* people. The work is always exciting. The product is something you use every day.
1529,Too many engineers so quickly.,Good money and free food.
1530,Needs more career advancement guidelines option for all levels,Great Uber credits benefits for all staff!
1531,"Everyone (correctly) talks about the hours. I used to work a true 9-5 and I have a wife so previously, work-life balance was important to me, but that was because my work was unfulfilling. I love the work I'm doing now and don't count the hours since I'm working on problems that I'm personally interested in solving. As the company scales and gains efficiencies, I can see some of the hours reduce. The salary was a step down from my previous salary, but the equity more than outweighs that downside.","The biggest pro is that even as Uber grows as a company, it remains an organization run by owners at every level. As an owner, I'm entrusted, enabled, and empowered to drive the business forward in the best way I see fit. I don't have to wait for rounds and rounds of alignment. This means I can just be be a creative problem solver and don't have to worry about what happens if an idea fails. The goal is to test something out and pivot from there. If something works, great! Go deeper and scale! If not, great! We've learned something that enhances our understanding of the business and can be more effective going forward. There's no time to worry about posturing or how things are perceived. The people in my office (like every other office) only help to reinforce that culture. I've got a built in support network that is always willing to drop what they are doing to help me achieve my goal. No one has ever said \"
1532,"The application/interview process took quite a bit of time. I received a phone call 2 months after I applied and then the interview involved tons of paperwork I had to print, fill out, and scan back. Without a computer, printer, or scanner this took a lot of creativity.",Amazing job! I have never had such an amazing experience as I have since working for Uber. It's a fast paced environment with great people and lots of opportunities for advancement.

You are missing out every day that you are not here with us :),"All what I loved from my previous professional experiences is now all wrapped together here at Uber: I used to be an architect and urban planner and I found maps, beautiful designs and awesome data visualisations everywhere. I used to be a consultant and I found the best ppt slides, strong data and MECE arguments all over. I used to work in the development field and my work now is positively impacting and changing society every week for REAL. I used to work in Thank Tanks and Foundations to create innovative solutions to analyse and transform the urban realm and I am finally in the best environment for urban innovation ever. I've always loved to work in multidisciplinary teams form all over the planet and I am doing it right now. I feel totally empowered.

It's really easy to get pulled into your work. And what makes that a pro, is that everyone at Uber is doing the same thing, its both an encouraging and inspiring place to work at.

They are constantly coming out with innovative ways to take people for point A to point B and they focus on everyone hustling and owning the business.  It's definitely not a clock in and clock out type of environment because everyone takes 100% ownership in what they do and expect to work until it gets done."

To me (and other good fits) these are actually pros, not cons. You have the freedom to solve big problems the way you think is best. Everyone here works a lot, so if you have a vibrant life outside of the office, you'll probably struggle. Even after a 13-hour day, I feel like I have a good work-life balance just because I find work so fun and my coworkers so bright and quick and funny; I'd rather be in the office than at home.","Uber is the dream job if you like solving problems, winning, being creative, finding ways to get over being stumped, and seeing your work take effect fast. Its high-stress, high-creativity, high-reward environment is addictive and and fun.\r\n\r\nThe company strives to keep the bar high by only hiring flexible, intelligent, talented people.

1581,Uber office workers treat drivers with disdain.\r\nDrivers are being treated as a number.\r\nEven unruly and drunk Riders are given options to rate drivers.\r\nUber's Owners are very arongant,"As a researcher I come to discover that Uber has a lousy customer service related to the partners.  Uber Support team is very narrow minded since I have personally witnessed drivers being treated with disdain as the best way for Uber to “allegedly” support their riders. I long for the day when no one would want to drive for Uber anymore unless Uber shows respect and add to the values to their partners.  Drivers are the faces that riders see not the $55 Billion team sitting in the crystal tower with more lawyers than the American Bar Association.  Not being honest with the drivers/partners is sending a message from corporate that this is how the game is played, therefore the driver passes this subtitle along to the rider and oftentimes unconsciously.\r\nFor example Uber claims in a document published on January 30, 2015 that drivers will be charged 20% for UberX and 28% UberXL request and an additional $1 safe ride fee. Those fee seemed to have been acceptable but after April 12, 2015 Uber started charging more without notice."

No one ever gets to exceed expectations in performance reviews, and they will tell you that (there goes a motivation factor)\n- you get no recognition, no matter how well you do - yet another point the company is very vocal about\n- company politics are nothing like I've ever seen\n- your performance review may read: You did not work more than 40-50 hours/week, Uber is not a 9-5. If your review lists this and nothing more that's 'negative', you will not have 'met' expectations\n- expectations are not laid out and you won't know what they are until your review. Hired for A - expected to do H.\n- favoritism and nepotism is big\n- while females and parents get hired, if they want to keep their family a priority, they will struggle\n- comments of sexist nature or against people with disabilities get swept under the rug. \n- you cannot voice your concerns (in a professional and respectful manner). No matter how you spin it, you are complaining. When you talk to management about a problem you need help with, you are expected to keep it quiet and come up with a solution yourself. Bringing it up (no matter how big), will shift the focus on you and you will be the problem for speaking up.\n- it's more about how many hours you are at the office, rather then the quality of your work (i.e. 40 hrs of quality work \< 60 hrs of mediocre work)\n- pay and equity is low for the time that's expected of you (well under market).\n- very aggressive and negative company culture","I got none - other than it being a known, successful company"
1592,"We have to work extra hours, it was really busy",I can feel passionate and the team was interesting
1593,"- If you come from another big company, you will miss the tooling, infra, etc as it is still under development at Uber","- Unlike some of the other good engineering shops, Uber gives you a chance to develop something from ground up.

Very little gets in the way of you building something new.\r\n- The company is very open to change. It is pleasantly surprising how much I was able to change and influence as an Engineer in my first few months."

The next big thing is the on-demand app economy, and Uber is the front-runner for that. It feels great to ride this wave -- both in terms personal finances, and the impact we're able to make. The overall company objectives are awesome too... i mean why shouldn't a person be able to give another person a ride for a fee, so long as we can guarantee 99.9%+ safety? \r\n\r\nUber is at the center of an epic disruptive story, and it's so fun to see how it plays out."

1610,"- The growth of the team has times outpaced the growth of processes and support staff.

People were flexible. I was ultimately even able to open source part of my project!\r\n• Very transparent. Everyone knows how the business is doing. Every new service proposal is emailed out to all engineers. The weekly all-hands meeting is so interesting.\r\n• Fantastic engineering culture. People are enthusiastic about learning from each other. Engineers share what they are working through weekly tech talks. I even got to give a talk as an intern. Also, we are expected to write great code so code reviews are a key part of the development process.\r\n• Unique/multi-disciplinary tech company.

1628,"uber is one of the most scrutinized companies in the world. it's also a very convenient villain, and misconceptions abound. Politicians get exposure by opposing uber, and some find there is more to gain by doing so than by serving the interest of their constituents. This can be frustrating. My internal (and informed!) view of uber is very different from what i can read about it.","my engineering team has an excellent technical level. I'm learning a lot. We have great discussions. Lots to do too, and many opportunities to do super high-impact work. \r\nAt a macro level, we are doing something important and valuable - taking cars off the roads, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, enabling passengers with more transportation options."
1629,"From a coding standpoint, Uber is a weird mix of incredible sophistication and, shall we say, not so great code.  From what I've seen, this is probably a function of startup style code trying to get features out the door, the large number of engineers at the company and lack of bureaucracy (empowerment applies equally regardless of skill level), and the small team oriented nature of the company built around services.  While a service oriented architecture scales well and has a myriad of benefits, what no one seems to talk about that I've witnessed firsthand is that isolated services don't necessarily get the influence of some of the technically strongest people.  Some services are incredibly well written, others will probably need to be rewritten before long.  This has really been my one frustration with Uber.\r\n\r\nAnd to put my complaints in perspective, I'd at least say that problems like this should be seen as why Uber is trying to hire more great people to get in there and resolve those issues.  I otherwise don't know how management could easily influence this in a better direction.  Otherwise, things are run fairly well I think to the best of reasonable expectations.",-First software company I've worked for where friends/family immediately understand what you actually do\r\n-Write code that lots of people actually use and pay for...gives a real sense of satisfaction to see your work live in production\r\n-Lots of worthwhile problems to solve\r\n-Great location in SF

1634,"There should be more of a focus on education and training, especially for new hires.

Yes, we all work very hard but there's flexibility around how it is done: you can work from home or cafe or whatever and make your own hours if you need to be somewhere personal.","i get to work with an insanely smart group of people on a very hard problem - changing transport in Sydney. Everybody is so motivated. City Teams at Uber are small so you get to be part of everything - In one day you could be working on marketing, analytics, meeting with drivers, a press release, interviewing new staff, meeting an MP, or literally painting a wall at the office."
1642,The nature of the work can be tedious much like other support centers no matter how hard you try to spin it. The hours don't work well for me.

You will likely have to start out as a contractor for temporary employment and if and when you do become an employee you may receive compensation for a gym membership. Free lunch or dinner depending on your shift and all the snacks and beverages you could care for.
1643,"Some aspects of the tech stack are a bit rough around the edges, experiencing growing pains which can occasionally hamper productivity. More automation would be useful. Process requirements can sometimes slow down an engineer's ability to get their change in prod. Sometimes this will take a bit of active communication on your part.  Expect to be on call and support your services as well (a strong incentive to write reliable code!).\r\n\r\nIf you value work/life balance above all else, I won't sugarcoat it. This is probably not the place for you. If you're down to come work hard on a world-changing mission, I doubt you'll be bothered by this.","Exciting, unique vision for the future - not your typical tech company. We are transforming a fundamental human need: transportation, of people, goods and services. Despite all the negative press I truly feel I'm making the world a better place through my work. We provide a service that creates unprecedented value for all we interact with. Our corporate values are not BS; they actually provide useful, detailed insights.\r\n\r\nTotal compensation is top notch and equity upside is still incredibly high, even in July 2015. Strong bias to equity in comp aligns incentives effectively. You will push yourself to be the best you can be, as the stakes are incredibly high. I cannot understate that the equity offered is not some marginal amount. It will move the needle for your life.\r\n\r\nBenefits are quite good as well, with free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, plus free medical, vision, dental and life insurance. The cafeteria food is reasonably healthy and tasty, with lots of vegetables and a meat entree, a salad and sandwich bar, plus quality snacks. No 401k match, although I'm of the opinion this would be a waste of company funds anyhow. You will be taking Uber all over the place with the free credit every month."

1651,"Uber faces stiff competition in Asia. The company moves extremely face to get ahead, which means the work is more challenging than at your typical Silicon Valley tech company.","- A lot of startups claim to be changing the world. Uber actually helps people in 300+ cities earn an income and get around. It doesn't get higher impact than that.\r\n- Great engineering. Uber is pushing the boundaries of what dynamically typed, interpreted languages can do. It also picked up Node and Go when they were still very new and is now a leader in both.\r\n- Many problems the company faces can only be solved by a combination of technology and people. For example, how can we help concert-goers get to and from Coachella? The solution involved both product and operations teams. Even as an engineer I'm learning a lot about business just by following what our city teams and leadership do."

You need to be comfortable with ambiguity and not being afraid to just step up and fill the void. Most start-up & entrepreneurial folks love this, but others find it a con.","Fast-moving ownership culture -- you build what you want, launch it out, iterate quickly, make an impact. I previously worked at Google, which is a fantastic place, but it moves so slowly due to it being a permission culture (where everything needs approval).  At Uber, I'm free to make decisions and own the outcome, which means we can move really quickly. I feel young again!"
1655,There is so much to be done that I have not found an optimal work life balance yet.,"It is so refreshing to work for a company where everyone is so passionate.  Each employee is fighting to make Uber a better place everyday so that together we can make the world a better place.  Together we are creating the processes and the change.

1666,"Constant change and the overseas workers are very bad at their jobs so your job is basically just cleaning up their mess. They are phasing out all the work from home workers in the US so they can take over, too. You never know when someone is going to disappear and nobody will tell you what's going on. No heads up whatsoever about your contract being extended. I've met with my manager twice in 6 months. No values.",The pay is nice and working from home is great.

This is a good problem to have though :)","As a software engineer at Uber, I get to work on products that ship to millions of users and improve their lives in a very tangible way. We are constantly innovating, designing new products and features, and shipping them fast. Our roadmap is heavily data-driven, and we use the information we collect to make informed decisions about what works and what doesn't. Engineers at Uber have a lot of say in how products are architected and designed, and communication across the entire organization is very open.

It's a fresh start.\r\n- The overall mission of the company makes total sense.\r\n- Being a part of an epic disruption story is exciting.\r\n- Revenues are astronomic, in uncharted territory for a start-up / private company. This makes 2015 an extremely good time to join.\r\n- I work as hard as any other Silicon Valley engineer. We work hard, but not too hard, and there is work/life balance."

Just get on.' Uber is a rocketship. I learned more in my first 3 months at Uber than I did in my 7 years in previous jobs. The calibre of people here is unbelievable. We are all on a mission to change the world. Right now, we are connecting riders to drivers - who knows what we will be doing in 5 years from now! Trust me - you want to be a part of this story."

Filled with young, smart folks that want to see this amazing product be accessible to more and more people, it feels like folks on on a mission."
1692,"If working longer hours is not of interest to you, this might not be the best option. Also, there is an emphasis on autonomy here, which is not for everyone.","From day one, I felt genuinely welcomed by all of my coworkers. The Uber family is one you definitely want to be a part of, and I could not be happier here. Everyone here works their tails off, they're motivated to succeed, having bought into the idea of Uber as a whole. Best of all, the team is here to help -- whether it be on a rider or driver initiative, an issue running data analysis, creating rider and driver communications, and so on. Working on a remote team has been an incredible experience and given me the opportunity to hone in on my entrepreneurial spirit while improving the cities we run. It's a rewarding career/company and one I hope to be a part of for years to come."

So many hard engineering problems, product problems, and finance problems. It's easy to learn a ton, and it's awesome to be a part of such an interesting company.

With that growth comes lots of change, and you will feel very uncomfortable if you are used to being in a predictable environment.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance may be a deal breaker for some. We're trying to grow the team as fast as the number of problems we're facing is growing, but sometimes the latter outpaces the former and the days can get very long, but the work is usually still exiting. I've never been told to work on a weekend, but I have voluntarily spent a few at the office building something I wanted to make.","Startups love to talk about how they're 'killing it', even though usually they're just struggling to survive to their next round of funding.  The focus on Uber isn't on 'killing it', everyone knows we're already doing that; we want to know what we can do to kill it faster.\r\n\r\nCompensation is extremely competitive, and includes something that no other company can offer: equity in one of the fastest growing companies in history.  Even now, Uber is out of its infancy and continuing to double revenues every six months.\r\n\r\nTransparency within the company is a big part of our culture. There's a weekly meeting where anyone in the company can ask the CEO a question and get an honest/unfiltered response.\r\n\r\nYou get to work with a lot of extremely talented people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  I've met people at HQ from six different continents, and I'm currently the only male engineer on my team. Diversity is a common buzzword these days, but at a company as small and simultaneously global as Uber it's also a reality."
1699,"Uber moves fast and we have to because we live and work in an ever changing world of regulation, culture, supply, demand, and on and on.\r\n\r\nWorking at Uber isn't for everyone.  Everyone at Uber is dedicated to the company and each person does what it takes to make Uber a success.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean you work till midnight every night or the weekends?  Sometimes.  Is that a weekly thing? No, it's rare but it will happen.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean you'll get woken up at 3AM to take care of a critical issue that's happening during the day across the world? Sometimes.  Is that a daily thing? No, it's rare but it will happen.\r\n\r\nBut to me, none of it matters because Uber is a company, product, and vision that I care about and am dedicated to.","I like to say working at Uber is great because of the four Ps. \r\n\r\nP - Product\r\nP - People\r\nP - Process\r\nP - Problems\r\n\r\nProduct:\r\nOur product is something that I use every single day.  I've worked at various companies in both the B2B and B2C sector and I've never cared about a product as much as I do Uber. Getting around a city (both where I live and where I travel) was always a pain before Uber.  Now when I leave my house I don't have to worry about how I'm going to get there because the answer is Uber.\r\n\r\nPeople:\r\nThe people that I work with are amazing.  They come from all walks of life and each person has a different background . People here have individually accomplished so much and have worked so many places in their past that there is always something to learn.  Scaling AWS at Amazon, building the infrastructure of Yelp, and building Amazon's product in the early days are just a few of the amazing accomplishments that my co-workers have achieved.\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\nGet stuff done and Uber will provide you the tools and resources to do that.  \r\n\r\nNeed a vacation?

Communication could be better as I am left out from important updates that are critical for me to perform my job as a contractor.",I like the enthusiasm that everyone has and how we all work and play hard. It's a cool place to work and come to each day. It's never a dull day!
1702,"- Compensation (unless you're an engineer). 12hr+ work days, yet still a constant worry about paying those SF monthly bills. I've been here about a year now and have noticed most people seem to be working here to either a) satisfy their want to make a huge impact and escape corporate America, or b) to push through the low salary in order to get to the IPO.\r\n- Lack of leadership. Uber's a great company because we hire entrepreneurs. Put a bunch of all stars on one team, there will be conflict and egos. In my opinion, it's a blessing and a curse. You certainly want all stars because those people will do great things, but you also want really solid coaches to help you learn how to bring out your full potential and to teach you how to bring out the full potential of those around you.","+ The people.

1703,"There are times where you'll be given hard deadlines, simply due to regulatory demands and business contracts with partners. This can make some weeks more stressful than others.","Uber is a technology-first company. Despite its number of users growing exponentially month over month, the mobile product remains highly scalable and stable, unlike any other fast growing company that I have worked for.\r\n\r\nProduct teams, engineers, and designers collectively decide which features are the most important for upcoming sprints and, so during development, all hands are on deck and everyone involved is excited to build the feature."
1704,"You have to look out for yourself to make sure you have the support you need to do your job right. Self-starters do best. Very little hand holding. Fewer perks than other tech companies. Very demanding, of course.","Fast paced, tons of opportunities to contribute, great positive atmosphere, very sharp coworkers. Lots of very interesting and far reaching problems being worked on. Attracts passionate people who are the best at what they do."
1705,"Long hours, but the reality is everyone here works long and hard because they want to and there is a real purpose to the job.  If working long hours towards a mission isn't appealing, this is not the job for you.","Amazingly flat feeling to the hierarchical structure where every employees opinion is valued and voice can be heard.  There is a great sense of transparency coming from the top down.  The sense of mission and desire to create a high value product, both for our riders and our partners is tangible everyday and the commitment is shown in the quality of people that are hired each and every day.

As a data-nerd this is amazing. The data is the single best reason for working at Uber.\r\nCulture is awesome (for someone who's never done the whole silicon valley thing before, that's the experience you get). You are working with world-class talent. I've met a couple hundred people here, not one of them is a person I would not want to work with. People are passionate, smart and focused. Uber will make you a more capable employee, better entrepreneur and impart that ability to get the right sh*t done so no matter what you do or where you go next, you will be able to do it better."

1709,"Being a relatively young company that grows exponentially fast, we do have to work pretty long hours. Personally I don't mind as I really love this company and I voluntarily work after I got home and on weekends too. I think this is just part of being working for a start-up company one truly loves.","* First and foremost, I truly believes in Uber's mission and have a deep conviction of the good that Uber is bringing to the society; this gives me a tremendous deal of satisfaction. By disrupting the monopolistic taxi industry, Uber is making transportation more efficient and bringing value to\r\n\r\n1) The drivers, who generally have much better pay than driving a taxi (because Uber gives drivers a larger cut of the fare than a taxi company would; because Uber makes rides more efficient so that drivers have less downtime and thus more trips). The drivers would also enjoy flexible hours and being a boss of his/her own (interestingly, this is consistently the #1 reason why drivers love Uber, at least from my personal experiences talking with dozens of drivers) \r\n2) The riders, by give them much better riding experiences (courteous and friendly driver, cleaner car, convenience in hailing a car, great customer service), as well as cheaper rides\r\n3) The society, by making more jobs (we are creating 50,000 jobs a month across the globe) and taking inefficiencies out of our economy\r\n4) The environment, by reducing the need of self-driving and car ownership, and encouraging ride sharing, Uber could make a potentially very large impact on our environment\r\n\r\n* Second reason why I love working for Uber are the people I work with. I am fortunate enough to be working in a team with both great leadership and great colleagues. Here we really work as team, everyone is very talented, works hard and helps each other, and we learn from each other and grow.\r\n\r\nAnd from what I know, this is not true of our team only but a general culture across the entire company --- you don't get this everywhere.\r\n\r\n* Last but not least, I am also fortunately enough to be working on a problem that's both technically/intellectually challenging, as well as contributing tremendously to Uber's business bottom-line. Being able to see our work makes real business impact gives me a lot of satisfaction working here."
1710,"A lot is demanded of employees, but that can be a pro or con depending on your perspective. Some employees can get wrapped up in the outside perception of us and not want to be a part of that. Management needs to continue to mature, watch their words, and 'grow up' as we grow and increase in importance.","It's cliched in today's post Silicon Valley tech world, but Uber is quite literally changing the world. There's something incredibly humbling and empowering knowing we're creating a product that is used around the world to improve lives. You might think I'm talking about the rider experience, but Uber is even more impactful on the lives of drivers who Uber helps enable them to make more money (whether supplemental or as an alternative to a lesser pay gig) and provides an opportunity to have more control over their lives than ever before.\r\n\r\nUnlimited vacation is cool, but we have a culture that you actually want to be a part of every day. There are so many exciting things happening at Uber that whatever else going on in your life doesn't seem as important. Crazy but true!\r\n\r\nUber's gotten a hard time in the press about our culture. I'd say that anything relating to misogyny or biased treatment towards candidates or employees is more of a symptom of a problem within society than Uber's culture. We hire the best candidates period. We all want to work with smart people that will help move the company forward. It's unfortunate that this means playing into all of the typical trouble tech companies get into with hiring predominantly white males. That said, I look around me on any given day and see a big variety of ages, genders and races.\r\n\r\nWe've also been criticized for our aggressive culture. We want to win in an extremely competitive space. Our company turns whole industries into our enemies. How can we be blamed that we have a thick skin that thinks of every way to defend ourselves and succeed?\r\n\r\nIf you don't believe my words and are think Uber is interesting, you owe it to yourself to connect with someone at Uber and come in to see it for yourself."

The variation and types of food catered is not that many, although the quality of the used ingredients is good.",I have the experience of working for 3 of the top software companies in the Bay area and have recently started working for Uber. I joined Uber among a handful of different other offers. I was a little doubtful before starting but am more than happy about my decision after spending sometime there. It is a great place to work with lots of opportunities to grow. It still has its startup culture focusing on rapid development and growth and avoiding common bureaucracy at larger companies. Everyone is friendly and supportive and you immediately feel as part of the family.
1713,"- As a company that is growing exponentially (global reach and it's personnel), we're constantly faced with new challenges in scaling people and processes, and although handling growing pains is well executed, it requires constant communication that sometimes isn't perfectly executed.\r\n- You'll get pushed to work hard and get a lot done. If you can't keep up with the work, it will impact your work-life balance.",- Smart people\r\n- Fast pace\r\n- Great leadership\r\n- Awesome benefits\r\n- Tightly knit teams/company\r\n\r\nWorking for a company that is driven by a vision that every employee shares makes working a pleasure. People here work hard and are great at getting things done. It also helps that we all use our application multiple times a week so we understand the product that we're building.
1714,None to speak of.  It's been an amazing experience since day one.,The caliber of people and the fact that good enough isn't ok.  We're always striving to be better!
1715,"Fast pace, lots of growth","Fast pace, lots of growth."
1716,Mileage pay rate has been decreasing due to competition with Lyft\r\nPutting so many miles on car\r\nOccasional taxi standoffs\r\nAnother con is that customers cannot tip through the app.  Sooooo many more customers would tip drivers if they could and it would keep drivers happy even with lowered rates.,Make own hours\r\nWork as much as you want to\r\nUber gave me so much freedom and an hourly wage in the high 20's when I couldnt find a job.
1717,You work...a lot. People lacking hustle need not apply.,"We are like a huge family that is changing transportation across the WORLD! We work hard, play hard, and have so much fun doing it all."
1718,"-If you are looking for a 9-5, then this is not the company for you. have to be willing to work long hours and rapidly produce results","-Amazing place to work, where you feel like your work actually makes a direct impact in the performance of the company\r\n-High Internal Mobility: Fantastic mentorship and management, where people who demonstrate continued excellence are able to advance into other new and interesting opportunities within the company\r\n-Working with some of the smartest people I have ever met\r\n-Infectious enthusiasm amongst employees: within your first week of being here, you cant help but drink the kool-aid and become extremely excited about whats being built here. Culturally, everyone brings a lot of passion and intensity, and that type of enthusiasm is contagious"
1719,"If you're not excited about constantly upping your game, it can be challenging.","Uber's growing really really fast. As such, there's constantly a ton of things to learn, which makes it a dream opportunity if you're starting your career. You'll get exposed to a lot of different challenges, and will be given a lot of autonomy to attack them."
1720,- Unpredictable hours\r\n- Lots of new managers and teammates who learn on the job\r\n- Highly competitive (I also view this as a strength)\r\n- Lunches are eaten at your desk,"- Fast-paced environment\r\n- Decisions are made for data-based reasons, not politics or because \"
1721,No big cons. It's an intense environment so be ready to work hard.,"Very flexible team culture. Opportunity to work on a vast number of initiatives. The best idea always wins, and it doesn't matter who's idea it is.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a work hard, play hard environment."
1722,"There are very smart people at Uber, but most are very inexperienced. That's not to say the brilliance doesn't shine through, but when it comes to admitting failures on certain initiatives, they are ofter masked with flattery because of maturity level.","Uber is not for everyone. If you are looking for a place that you can clock in and clock out of at 40-50 a week, move on. Uber is a place for you to obsess over. You will find that most of your thoughts and ideas relate to your work."
1723,"You are not going to see your friends and family very often. This job is extremely demanding, so definitely not for everyone. You have to be ok, with the controversies surrounding the company and occasional hostility from people in your social circles.","Unprecedented amounts of freedom and independence. You are basically able to run your own start-up, but you have access to the company's know-how and budget. Very close collaboration between cities, knowledge sharing is great, you can always ask for help and receive great advice. Managers are leaders rather than bosses. Great examples come from the top and trickle down to the rest of organization. You get to work with some of the smartest, most hard working people in the world. Learning curve is basically vertical."
1724,"The job requires long work hours. Like - always working.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's work that I WANT to do to make the company better, so no complaints here.",I love being able to make positive change to a company from the ground up - but we also have the opportunity to make positive change to the WORLD which is a major plus! The culture is so on point - EVERYONE loves what they do here. Everyone is extremely passionate.\r\n\r\nI would have a VERY difficult time ever working for another company that doesn't share the same culture and values and hustle as Uber does.
1725,It's a young company and a lot of the communication and process could be streamlined. It takes a lot of work to get up to speed and understand what is going on. There are a ton of things to work on and it can be hard to prioritize the most urgent work from good long term investments.,This is an incredibly mission oriented fast placed environment. Everyone is so willing to help and no one shies away from hard problems. When fires come up (and it is a small startup so we have fires) everyone jumps on and solves the problems. \r\n\r\nEveryone feels a real passion for the mission and there is a true belief that we have an opportunity to build a better global transportation system.
1726,"Feels a little more traditional than many startups, though I suppose it doesn't fall into the startup category anymore. It's possible in many roles to have a fairly 9-6 job, but there are times when the social calendar has to be pruned a little. If you're coming from Facebook or Google, the internal tooling isn't quite as fancy yet.","My cultural experience at Uber has been everyone pushing hard to find the best solutions to the biggest problems. Politics exist in every company, but facts and data win arguments here more than at any of previous employers. The growth rate and ability to use the product all the time are hugely rewarding, and are not a small part of why work is fun."
1727,-Work/life balance is poor.  \r\n-Pay is low for hours worked\r\n-Company focuses on hiring extremely young = mistake,-Meaningful Work (providing thousands of jobs)\r\n-You get to wear many many many hats if you are on a city team \r\n-The job is like nothing else! It grows before your eyes. \r\n-Innovative culture and ppl are unique/energetic/and smart.
1728,"- This is not a place for you if you need a lot of process/structure to succeed\r\n- Be prepared to work as hard as everyone around you, which is really hard. I don't actually see/hear anyone complaining excessively about the hours though because everyone's so into what we're doing here.","- Highly transparent, entrepreneurial, autonomous culture.\r\n- Accountability over approval. Move fast, make the right (data-driven) decisions, and don't let bureaucracy/process slow you down. \r\n- Lots of hard and interesting problems to solve. We're moving atoms with bits.\r\n- Tons of upside potential for the business and lots of room for individual growth.\r\n- Still a great ground-level opportunity. Helping to shape important product/policy/processes every day.\r\n- No excuses. People get things done here."
1729,"Work-life balance can be tricky; It's easy to work a 14 hour day and not realize it. At the same time, there are married folks on the team who work more flexible hours with no discrimination from management. You're free to work from home if you want. It's a culture that as along as your getting everything done plus some it doesn't matter how many hours you work or where you work from.","The flexibility to work on the projects you enjoy the most is the biggest pro for me. My job changes on a quarterly basis as I find new sprint projects that turn into full time gigs, and management allows for me to experiment and try new things all the time. There is a lot of trust within teams and everyone is always willing to pitch in. It's truly a family environment."
1730,"Sometimes the work/life balance can be a bit skewed, but it's improved since I started!","You feel really close to your coworkers, the company really takes care of you by providing fitness and meal perks in the office.  Still a start-up feel but a professional environment."
1731,"If you're the type of person who likes rigid structure and linear growth paths, be advised that we like to keep things fluid - this allows for better growth, educated decisions about team dynamics and structure, and allows the best of the best to shine in collaborative mediums.","Employee perks, company notoriety, ownership of large-scale tasks, fast-paced environment, leaderboard culture. Compensation, extremely rewarding work, incredibly smart employees, amazing company culture."
1732,"If you're looking for a 9-5 job where you can clock in and clock out, Uber is not that place. There's some growing pains but it's expected for a company going through hyper growth.","Really smart, great people; one of the best leadership team; challenging problems to tackle; huge market opportunities.  For an individual, there are still opportunities to make a big impact."
1733,"Changing the world is hard work. Sometimes that means long startup-like hours. People don't stay late because they have to, though. They genuinely want to. You also need to be comfortable with ambiguity and shifting areas of focus. I can't speak for the driver experience, but the employee experience is hard work but with great reward.","Uber is filled with smart, talented people who honestly want to make a difference. Whether it's headquarters or the city teams, the employees are always trying to push the boundaries. People are empowered to do what they believe is best and that dynamic makes for an exciting environment. I'm struck by the passion and focus.\r\n\r\nThe path that the company is on is amazing. While growth is important to scale to the current product, where Uber is headed is a huge selling point for new people to join. I've never been more challenged and yet supported in my career."
1734,"The hours are sometimes long but while my manager regularly tells me to take vacation, I enjoy the work that I do.  We could just use a few more hands.","I have the best team and I am constantly challenged to solve new and interesting problems. The nature of the business makes for a very unique set of challenges but also leads to a lot of growth opportunities. Given all of our growth, it's a very fun and exciting atmosphere. We're changing the world and I am so proud to be a part of it!"
1735,"The worst thing about Uber is comp. We get a good amount of equity which will 100% be worth it in the end, but if you're coming from Finance or Consulting expect a 20-30% cash pay cut. \r\n\r\nThe hours used to be maddening but we've done a much better job at hiring recently. The work life balance has gotten  a lot better but it's still really hard to disconnect. Expect to always be on and get pulled away during major holidays, events, promos, etc. We're always sprinting.","Best thing about working at Uber is the autonomy. You're given a ton of responsibility to build awesome products and if you're willing to roll up your sleeves and get right into the weeds of a problem - you'll do well here. The company is growing at such an incredible pace that there's a new challenge each and every day.You'll never be bored and there's always something fun to work on. \r\n\r\nThe benefits are also top notch - riding in Black Cars, catered lunches, and free healthcare is pretty awesome."
1736,"Cons\r\n- We work a ton of hours to support the crazy growth of the business.  I hope the culture eventually simmers down eventually.   I love my job despite the long hours but if it's still this way three years from now, I'd hate to see that.\r\n- The start up culture is great, but we could work on communicating important things intra-office better.  Sometimes I don't realize I've been volunteered for something until after it's already past due.",Just a quick note before getting into the pros- it seems like there are quite a few Uber Partner reviews from drivers on Glassdoor which don't necessarily reflect the Uber Employee reviews you're expecting to read.  Please be mindful of that.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n- having a job that everyone loves to talk about!\r\n- getting to meet great partners and clients (drivers and riders)\r\n- intellectually challenging work\r\n- making an impact in the community\r\n- the modern culture that I wish all companies had (good-bye corporate)
1737,Lots of work + passionate coworkers + tireless management = work-life balance difficulties. Luckily most days being in the office with coworkers is more stress relieving than holing up in a coffee shop to work by yourself.,"Challenging problems to solve, smartest coworkers in the business, beautiful office space. Lots to keep an engineer busy, as evident by the growing number of 4+ year employees (only a 5 year old company!)."
1738,"Since company is on a huge growth path, the office is getting crowded. But the working environment is very stylish and there is already a plan to expand the office space.","Smartest and most passionate people. Everyone in the team are excited about the impact and opportunity. People believe Uber is changing the way people live. This is the kind of work that every morning when you wake up, you feel like your achievement will be rewarded and you are proud of what you are doing."
1739,"Very long hours and less opportunity for work-life balance. But at the same time, who cares if you're putting in long hours and have a mind-blowing amount of responsibility if you believe in your company's innovation, absolutely love what you do, and love who you're doing it with more!? Uber is not a job; it is a lifestyle, and it should be appreciated as such. The lightning pace, frequency and degree of constructive change, and sheer amount of talent in this workplace make it like no company on earth. The historical opportunity to be here now is what keeps me striving.","The absolute best part about working at Uber is the exceptional caliber of our team. I'm surrounded by work-hard, play-hard, hustle-obsessed, results-oriented people that inspire me to constantly become more efficient, learn, and achieve."
1740,Work life balance can sometimes be a challenge but it is all about learning to prioritize and what you get in return is so much more,"It is hard work at Uber but you get some much in return: you are working with the most talented and intelligent people in the industry, you get so much responsibility that allows you to develop yourself, if you perform well there are lots of opportunities for promotions,....."
1741,There is technical debt on account of growing so fast. There is a lot more work that needs to be done on the infrastructure side.,"The team at Uber is truly awesome. Right from the CEO to the engineer right out of college, everyone seems to be self-driven, optimistic and go-getter. There is a lot of product focus in the engineering ranks. The people are smart and there is willingness to do whatever it takes.  Combine this with great product market fit and what you have is a truly amazing company which will the iconic company of this decade. I believe that Uber will be bigger than Facebook and Google and will touch people's life all around the world."
1742,"-Food is not the best\r\n-We work really hard, so had to cut down some time spent with family. I'd say there's still work life balance though.","-Fast paced. We move really fast and fix things all the time.\r\n-As an Engineer I'm able to drive a lot of product directions, basically being a mini-PM, which I personally enjoy very much.\r\n-Probably best startup in the valley right now in terms of growth rate. I really believe Uber will hit it big."
1743,"This is the fastest growing company, ever. So obviously being in that hyper growth phase, you need to work a lot of hours, but I've seen a worst.","Working at Uber is really fulfilling. We work on hard and interesting problems, the company is extremely flat so everyone has a voice and can bring ideas to execute on.\r\nEvery single employee is smart and extremely passionate about the business, which makes the work environment amazingly motivating and energizing.\r\nIt offers amazing career opportunity for everyone. \r\nFree Uber and other perks are also nice obviously."
1744,"If you're not into fast-paced, challenging work environments this might not be the place for you. The talent bar is very high and so are expectations.","Fast-paced, challenging work environment. Opportunity to work on big things which are changing cites and the way of life of millions of people."
1745,"Can't think of many cons. It isn't for everyone, there is a lot of work that needs to be done and not enough people to do it so expect to work long hours.",Lots of opportunity for growth. The perks are amazing. Everyday is a new learning opportunity. Catered lunches and random company-wide perks. Cool people. Work for an awesome start-up revolutionizing how transportation works.
1746,Dinner is too late. 8:15pm? It's not good for your body.\r\nI don't see much cons.,You own your product. That makes you put your time in it voluntarily. \r\nOpportunities for career development in a fast growing company.\r\nFood is good.\r\nKitchen is good.\r\nUber credit is good.
1747,Nothing big yet. Hyper growth comes with a set of challenges -- but that's what makes it fun!,"Smart, collaborative, ambitious, friendly team. Strong leadership, yet very little is top down. Lots of autonomy and opportunity. Amazing growth which makes everything more fun (and challenging)!"
1748,"Intensity, autonomy, winning ideas that come from anyone in the company regardless of seniority or tenure... Ingredients that make us successful, but certainly not for everyone.",Fast-moving risk-taking engineering culture where we work hard but are constantly rewarded by experiencing the success of our efforts. The level of intelligence and the level of fun on our team amazes me every day.
1749,Work/life balance can be tough for new employees!,"The work you do is impactful\r\nThe people are amazing, at a local level and at a global level"
1750,Very tough challenges on our day to day work but definitely interesting.,Awesome company with lots of opportunities and a ton of things to learn!
1751,"We have the standard issues related to hypergrowth, but nothing that negatively affects your work. Work life balance is obviously much more sided towards work, but that's what you sign up for. If you want to be on a rocket ship, then you shouldn't be concerned with how much time you have to put in. I enjoy every day at Uber, and if you're a hustler, and think you'll thrive in a fast paced environment where you can make anything happen, then there aren't any cons.","We're the fastest growing company on the planet. For the individual, Uber makes it so you can literally do anything - Uber uncaps your potential. You'll work hard, and you'll be pushed to your limits (unimaginable limits) in the best way possible. It's a very open environment with high transparency. There's not many other companies doing what we're doing right now. Travis is a visionary, and will inspire you to grind it out every day."
1752,"We work longer hours than the typical 9-5 job, but that is because Uber has places to be, people to see, and paradigms to change. Timing is flexible and team communication is open enough to work through any potential timing snafus.","Uber has some of the brightest minds working on cutting-edge projects involving all-hands on deck. From world-class deals and litigation that is changing the face of tech-law, to scaling exponential growth and moving globally lightening fast, we work crazy hours sometimes because this is the most exciting place to be! Leaders of the industry in each respective field are working to build a new economy driven by instant consumer input. The best ideas win and the focus is on creating something great. It's inspiring to work here!"
1753,"You'll probably get asked to do things you have no idea how to do, and will be expected to figure it out on your own. You need to be comfortable with putting yourself out there to find answers. You'll probably have a few late nights while getting up to speed.","The best thing about working here is the fact that you get to solve problems at a very large scale. Every thing you do here is used by millions of people, and pushed to performance limits. Uber has a good onboarding process, including a week of training and weekly sessions that anyone can attend. You get thrown into the fire quickly, and will be asked to solve problems right from the start. This can be stressful at first."
1754,"Perks could be better. Since I am periodically on-call, I'd like it if my cell phone was covered.","The office culture is super positive. People are WAY nicer than I thought they would be before I worked here. Everyone is positive and supportive. Compensation is largely based on the growth of the company continuing, so the stock options are where I expect a big payout, but the salary is competitive with startups in SF."
1755,"The fast growth of the company may not be for everybody, things are changing really fast.","After many year in a small company, I'm having great time at Uber. I'm learning a lot from skilled coworkers and I had opportunities to work on important project from the first week. I really love the transparency about internal metrics. \r\nAlso, great benefits."
1756,"The work life balance can be rough, all people here believe truly in Uber's mission and work 6-7 days a week to help this company succeed","I truly believe Uber is the most exciting company in the world to work for right now. Uber is changing a whole industry and the lives of so many people all over the world. The work itself, no matter which position is exciting, challenging and different every day, and the opportunities for growth are fantastic"
1757,We are disruptive to the point where sometimes you have to avoid talking about your career.,"Uber is flexible, accommodating, influential and filled with incredibly motivated and intelligent people. As far as benefits go, it is encouraged to move around the company to different teams to find your fit, there is flexibility to explore what moves you, time-off is unlimited, and everyone is encouraging to help you find happiness."
1758,(1) We could loosen up in the office a bit. Everyone is so heads-down \,"This is an exciting place to be. Uber is rapidly growing, and the sense here is that, if you're smart and passionate, you could do just about anything you want. We're really committed to the idea that \"

1760,"1) Hours can be long (trickles down from CEO who works 20 hrs a day), but that's standard for a company with as much to accomplish as we do\r\n2) Data and infrastructure growing pains as we continue to scale\r\n3) Remote offices sometimes feel distance between them and HQ",1) Learning from peers who are eager to share insights and teach technical skills\r\n2) Exceptionally close collaboration between PMs and Analysts\r\n3) Fearless leadership empowers us to take risks
1761,Long hours; the office is growing very quickly (starts to lose the feel of being a small/scrappier company),"Really interesting day-to-day projects, interacting with brilliant folks daily, strong management with great vision, lots of opportunity to have impact and drive results, really open culture that is open to debate, folks are still very respectful despite being a very driven/hard-working culture"

1763,"Lunches aren't the best I've had, but still pretty good overall ;)","Even though Uber is growing crazy fast, it still has a startup feel. The people I work with are super smart, driven, and helpful (that goes for all departments not just engineering). I find it really motivational that I get to work on hard problems that have a massive impact worldwide. Also it's great to tell people you work at Uber because almost everyone knows the product."
1764,Sometimes long hours. Cannot think any other cons.,"1) Great engineering culture. People are very nice here, and team members are very supportive. People who are working here are really excited and passionate about the product! I learnt a ton, and had fun everyday.\r\n2) Great perks. Such as catered lunch, gym membership reimbursement, etc."
1765,Work life balance can be a struggle when you're putting in the hours it takes to grow the company as fast as it has been in the past years. In the end you have to decide what you value more:  Your weekends or building something great with a team of amazingly talented individuals.,"Fast paced exciting work environment. Expect to work long, hard, and smart but never just two of the three. The teams here are built from all of the smartest kids in the class."
1766,"Because of how fast they move, sometimes it's hard to keep up do date on all the stuff Uber is doing around the world.","Uber is a fast moving company where you will never run out of work to do. Despite of this, the work life balance is very good. As long as you're productive when your here you'll have no problems. My favorite thing about Uber is how fast they move. They experiment a lot and prefer to try things instead of theorize about them."
1767,"Since you work on things that matter, when you break something, you have to fix it. Not really a big problem, as I believe engineers should be responsible for fixing things the break, but I've had to kill a few Saturdays fixing a mistake I made on Friday.","As a new grad, I am given the opportunity to learn a ton and work on cool things that impact user's and other employees throughout the company. I feel like my work does have an impact on the company as a whole. I never have felt like I have been treated like a \"
1768,Really nothing to complain .,"- Making a large impact on engineering\r\n- Company is growing fast, lots of challenges\r\n- Modern stack in Python and NodeJS, uses Storm, Kafka and Spark\r\n- 8 hour work schedule, extra hours sometimes depending on yourself and your schedule\r\n- Equity compensation with much larger value that what I could get at Facebook/Google/LinkedIn, and huge upside potential\r\n- 400 Uber credits per month"
1769,people work very late here. the salaries are lower than other companies but the stock makes up for it a little. theres a lot of potential for stock to grow.,The company is very exciting and continuously working on new features and products. The people here are very smart and driven! Great tools in place to help the company team members run efficiently.
1770,"Definitely not a 9-5 job. You're expected to be (almost) always-on, so bring your A game! You do get vacation, and many weekends off, but in order to bring about the change we want, we work really hard to continue to make progress. Also, we get a lot of (unfair) negative press about issues that we don't really have time to adequately address and correct... so most people love us, but working here you have to be prepared to take criticism and Uber questions in your off time from friends and family etc., and answer in a diplomatic way but in a way that doesn't compromise our competitive advantages.","Uber attracts a wide of backgrounds, with people who excel at what they do. The environment is genuinely fast paced -- just look at how many cities we have launched in 2014. We hit 100 in April, then 200 at the end of this summer. In addition, we are genuinely making a real difference in the places we operate, connecting people with a reliable ride."
1771,The insane growth comes with it's downsides: Uber is no longer a scrappy startup where everybody knows everybody and you're all at least aware of what others are working on. Now days it's taken on a little more of a \,"Working at Uber has been awesome; it's a fast-paced environment where you're always on your toes to learn new things and implement the latest tech. There's so much going on behind the scenes at Uber that your opportunities are endless. Oh, and there's working for a company where every new startup seems to be an \"
1772,"Not getting bored means you have to take care of your own work/life balance. Nobody ever tells me to stay late or offers any judgment about my work hours. But at the same time there is a lot going on which is really fun to work on, and it is easy to find yourself working long hours and barely noticing.","Super smart and motivated team doing awesome work. The rate at which we release features is really exciting, and the product direction is leaping forward in some really interesting ways related both to hyper-growth and business direction. You will never get bored here!"
1773,There might be some long hours during busy seasons.,"This is the company that truly wants to change the world. The leadership team and colleagues all have fearless attitude that makes you super pumped, and people just work together to get things done. No office politics and very flat structured. Growing super quickly that's a good place for people with a career ambition. Very friendly and transparent culture from CEO to all employees."
1774,Food is not always that great. Dinner is served late.\r\nSometimes have to work late and long hours.\r\nPay could be more competitive.,"Great perks, decent compensation.\r\nGreat management. Everyone is encouraged to help shape and give ideas on the product.\r\nGood career path for engineers.\r\nInsanely hard working people who care deeply about the company."
1775,"with insane growth comes a lot of side effects, especially around lots of work usually ending up on your plate. There is a struggle on work-life balance, but we're getting good at this. But it's a good problem to have, considering it's a side effect of amazing growth.","a great place for passionate people. The culture is very open and transparent. As an engineer the whole code line is open for you, and you can work on pretty much anything you want to make an impact on. It's a very gratifying experience as you can make changes and see it touch peoples lives almost every day."
1776,"Long work hours seem very common, especially if you'll work on projects directly related to the car dispatching system.","Things are happening so fast at incredible scale, and so many opportunities are open to build new things with large impact."
1777,"We are growing so fast, meaning code evolves just as fast. It feels a little overwhelming, but it's exciting to make a personal goal to grow to be able to keep up. While I've never been asked to stay more than 40hrs/week, there is a strong vibe to work long hours and I've had to reconsider how I spend my non-work hours to be more efficient (maybe that's a good thing?). Not enough uber swag, I have to pay for my hoodie???","As a software engineer, there are a limitless number of different things to work on, and I'm working with a lot of other very excited and smart people..the best. Huge opportunity to learn and grow professionally as the company continues to hire more people. Equity compensation is very compelling, too good to say no. The executives are very transparent with regards to the company's performance. Free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, plus tons of fresh fruit and snacks."
1778,Hours are certainly long. Maintaining balance between personal and work life would be considered more of a con if colleagues weren't so much fun to be around. Could be tough on someone with children or a family at home.,"Everyone believes in the mission of the company, is extremely smart, and works very hard to contribute to company success. Management has empowered employees to be able to make a variety of decisions and there is very little bureaucracy at all. Teams around the world all develop a strong sense of camaraderie and pride and are constantly working to innovate. Always new problems to solve and satisfaction in the sense to contribute directly to company success."
1779,"Because of how frequently Uber is in the media and how many people use the product, as an employee you very frequently have to deal with people with very strong opinions against Uber. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and this is often the case with large startups, but it is something that you should expect to have to deal with.","The people you work with here are some of the most smart and impressive people that I've ever met. Everyone in the company, regardless of title is encouraged to talk about their ideas and make things happen. This has really helped it keep it's startup-like atmosphere that keeps people passionate about what they are doing. The rapid growth of the company also allows you to work on several different types of projects which is great for anyone looking to work on high-impact products and expand their professional skills."
1780,"1. I think the benefits could be a little more competitive with other companies. At the place I came from prior, I was able to get health care for my dad, the gym subsidy was higher (I end up going to the same gym as before, and my prior employer just paid the gym directly), and the food was a little better. Also we had a shuttle that picked me up directly from where I lived. Definitely not the most important thing.","I work on the Growth team at Uber; I joined two and a half weeks ago and it was a great move thus far.\r\n\r\n1. You're working on a product that a lot of people in San Francisco use in fact your close friends all use the product.\r\n2. Management (upper and lower-level) is very direct about everything, which minimizes the likelihood of politics. Most other people (afaik) at the company do care about their careers, but they care way more about Uber succeeding.\r\n3. Very talented frontend and backend developers whom you can learn a great deal from. People spend most of their time trying to learn more and doing their jobs better.\r\n4. The company is not risk-averse and is good at taking calculated risks in the market. In that sense the company still operates like a startup and is in a \"
1781,- Things breaking when they probably shouldn't because of an emphasis of getting things out super quickly.,- Amazing culture and atmosphere. The interactions you have in the first few weeks really gets you excited about the company and makes you feel like a big part of the development process.\r\n- Really talented people across the whole company. Can always depend on people in my team and other engineering teams when I need to collaborate on something.
1782,The only con I can come up with is how fast we're growing internally.  I have to spend a lot of time interviewing candidates,"I get to work with the smartest people I've ever worked with to build a product that I've used and loved since it first launched.  And I get to help bring this great product to new markets, giving consumers and job seekers an additional choice.  \r\n\r\nHere are 3 things besides the product and our mission that make me want to work harder\r\n1) Employees are given a lot of flexibility and trust.  I'm not encumbered by a lot of process.  I get to write code and deploy it that day.  \r\n2) The company is very open internally.  I feel like I have a very good idea of what we're doing and what our plans are.  \r\n3) Our CEO.  TK might be our hardest worker.  He's smart and principled and very candid at our weekly company-wide TK Q&A.  It's great having a leader you really believe in"
1783,"As with any high growth company, no everything is necessarily figure out.. There is lots & lots & lots of work to do, which could mean longer working hours.","A lot of reviews on glassdoor are from Drivers/Partners that don't capture how the engineering culture is.\r\n\r\nCompany is solving a really big & tough problem - ground transportation. There is a whole new level of reliability that is needed for Uber's systems, due to the fact that it is moving real people and things. FB/Twitter/... not loading for 20 mins is bad for the company's business. But Uber not working for 20 mins, means someone misses their interview or someone might be stranded for a while. \r\n\r\nSo, the company seems to be ready to invest in a lot of long term technology pieces needed to get there. So, if you are a developer hungry for working & experimenting new software systems, I would say Uber should rank among the top 3 places right now in the valley. \r\n\r\nPeople are nice and generally willing to help you out. Everyone is tuned (the onboarding process is very good at tuning new people also towards this) to working towards getting things out of the way and march towards the company's goals. So, if you believe in the vision of Uber and have an attitude of making progress, you will do absolutely fine here!"
1784,"The company is growing quickly, so be prepared to push through problems on your own at times as the usual bureaucracy isn't fully in place yet.","We have the mindset and velocity of a young company still trying to prove itself, but the resources and maturity of a company coming into its own. You get to work on hugely challenging problems, with a lot of resources to bring to bear."
1785,Not many good restaurants within walking distance.,Uber is the best tech company I have worked for. Uber has got this great momentum. It's exciting to be part of the company that is gonna Uberize the world. The senior management here is just top-notch. We recently hired the Obama's campaign manager to be our SVP. \r\n\r\nMy teammates are all very nice and fun to work with. Everyone has his/her own mentor to learn from. I enjoy coming to work everyday.
1786,There are high expectations of everyone within the company and some people may not be able to elevate their game. Leadership is trying to solidify how they operate and there are some growing pains. These are all good problems to have! Its better than companies that are contracting or consolidating to cut costs.,You might think its just an \

There are a lot of growing pains, though scaling at a mind boggling rate is an interesting problem in its own right.",Uber has been the first place that I've worked wherein I actually use computer science and can't solve problems by copying and pasting things from stack overflow.
1788,"Hours are long, but thankfully they make it fun.","Hypergrowth company with deeply rooted startup culture. Things are rolling fast. Both builders and hackers are valued here. Innovations and experimentations are greatly encouraged. Mistakes and failures are embraced as long as you learn from it. The leadership is strong. There are many interesting challenging technical problems to solve. How many companies out there are tackling all these areas including real time infrastructure, logistics, big data, machine learning geomatic engineering, mobile development?"
1789,"- People here are crazy about their work. They voluntarily works super hard. Probably it looks like it may be hard to maintain work/life balance, but I would say Uber becomes your life. It's definitely pro to me, but some might consider this as con.\r\n- The company's growing so fast, so the office is crowded and there may be several relocations. But Uber's buying several office spaces so hopefully this will go away soon.",- Everyone here's passionate about their products.\r\n- Awesome perks with lots of Uber credits.\r\n- Great people & projects & learns a lot.\r\n- Your role impacts a lot to the products. like A LOT!
1790,Growing faster than any company in recent memory results in certain growing pains - only the most determined need apply.,"Some of the most talented colleagues around and always a positive environment to push yourself - achieving the next milestone is part of the culture.  Great learning experience as the company grows and scales operations, there is definitely room to handle significant responsibility early in your career at Uber."
1791,Everything moves at a very high pace and everybody is expected to take a lot of responsibility. You need to be ready for that or it can be stressful.,The fast growth means that there is always new and interesting challenges and very motivating to know the difference that make changing the transportation market.\r\n\r\nFrom an engineering perspective the culture allow everybody to get involved in critical work. You can take on any challenge you feel ready for or want to figure out if you are ready for
1792,"The company is in a complex market, and tech journalists often don't understand the nuance. It could be frustrating to read a litany of seemingly negative articles, because the journalists don't understand the actual laws or issues. That's probably a downside to every company that's rapidly changing the world. People who don't work full time in that specific industry probably don't actually understand the issues in the industry.","Change the world. They're fundamentally changing the way people interact with the world, bridging the digital with the \"
1793,"You will work hard here, but you won't be alone at least.",Probably the best thing about working at Uber is the quality of my co-workers. Easily the best management team I have ever had the pleasure of working for. Another pro for me is due to the pace & growth of our company I am learning so much more than if I worked at a company that has plateaued. Daily challenges present themselves that are highly rewarding when you tackle them.

1795,"Poor outside perception, tough interview",Uber is an amazing place to work. I see a lot of less than stellar reviews come from people who aren't actual Uber Employees. As an engineer at Uber you get to work with the smartest most connected people in Silicon Valley. People like Pedram Keyani. It's an entrepreneurial company from start to bottom. Everyone cares and is very passionate. Compensation is amazing. The free food and perks are also equally amazing
1796,"The company is growing fast, so there is a constant challenge to figure out the best ways to communicate and organize. This is a good sign though as it always comes with success. It is promising though that upper management is constantly keeping an eye on growth issues and are always trying to adjust for our growth.",There are amazing engineering problems and features to work on. Our systems deal with real-time constraints at high scale. People work professionally and are dedicated to quality engineering and performance.\r\n\r\nThe company rewards high performance and gives lots of potential for career growth. The perks are awesome too!
1797,"Work life balance can be a challenge.  Need to be ready to put in long hours.  That said, you're surrounded by your team which makes it more manageable","Get to work with crazy smart, fun people on challenging/interesting problems that you wouldn't find elsewhere.  Always pushed to find creative solutions for everything that you do.  Amazing passion for the product from everyone in the company creates a great environment to work in."
1798,Uber requires me to work long hours but there is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel. Each city is like a startup so you can shape policies in your local office to make things work for you and your team.,Tons of autonomy. I've had the opportunity to run my own business unit. I've also had the opportunity to sharpen my analytical skills.
1799,"Rate of growth means cramped quarters, HQ location is a lunch/bar desert around the building, no offices - only pods.","Creative environment, fun coworkers, true vision for changing the world and leadership structure that values every idea - from intern to C-level."
1800,work/life balance isn't for everyone,"deep vision, cool products and roadmap, passionate employees, amazing talent, rocketship growth"
1801,"I don't have many cons, but the job is not for everyone - we need more people who thrive under autonomous, ambiguous situations and who are willing to put in the work required to take this company to the next level.","Uber is an incredibly exciting, fast paced place to work. I've never worked with a group of people so dedicated to what we're trying to do and so hard working toward achieving those goals."
1802,"There aren't many -- if you're willing to commit, there isn't really much missing here.","Working at Uber is a unique and wonderful opportunity. Every day I feel lucky that I get to work with such a smart, driven, and fun group of people. Everyone is passionate about the product and gives their all to ensure that Uber is the best it can be. The hours are long, but most people want to be working -- it's hard to step away when the office is such an energetic and exciting atmosphere."
1803,"Intensity of work and aggressive culture- for great reasons and with good results, but you'll have to self-moderate to keep yourself from burning out.","Company is amazing- intelligent employees, ambitious goals, passion and execution are unmatched. Can't believe how quick they're moving. Refusal to accept mediocrity."
1804,Not many. It's not a place to go if you just want a 9-5.,"Incredibly smart, dedicated, passionate people. People I want to work with and spend time with outside of work. The company is still in the early stages of growth. Huge amounts of opportunity for personal and professional growth. Does an impressive job of maintaining 'start-up' culture, especially given its velocity of growth.\r\n\r\nAlso, I usually don't like perks (I'd prefer money..), but I can't describe how useful free Uber credit is."
1805,"Long hours, but you couldn't ask for a better team to hustle with.","Getting to work with the cream of the crop daily. You will never work with a harder working or innovative team, EVER. this is something once in a lifetime. \r\nThe product is changing the world and it's so fun to see people outside the company love what you make while you love what you do."
1806,There is nothing that I would specifically consider a \,Fulfilling work. Focused and hard working culture. Transparent management. Refreshing experience. Fun and warm colleagues. = I've never been happier. And I previously worked at the last two hottest startups in Silicon Valley for the last few years.
1807,"The work is abundant and the office space is limited. With a staff that is doubling every 6 months, space is getting tight fast. But management is adding space as fast as they can to keep up, with excellent long term plans in place, I look forward to working here for a long time.","The quality of the employees, from IT, to Facilities, to Engineers, is out of this world amazing. Uber hires only the best, and it shows with the level of service and quality of work.\n\nThe office perks are slightly higher than an average perk-oriented startup; they offer full lunch and dinner, with beverages and snacks everywhere.\n\nEveryone is devoted to bettering the company and everyone is expected to do so."
1808,If \,"Extremely smart and hard charging culture.  If you want to get things done and make a big impact, this is the place!"
1809,Working long hours and the associated stress of completing a project on a tight deadline.,"There are lots of very interesting engineering problems to solve and engineers are given the bandwidth to tackle these problems, and to do so in a fast-paced environment. Not a lot of bureaucracy and the bit that does exist is easy to navigate.   Work life balance is good and the culture is solid. Working with lots of brilliant folks, and engineering training, means Uber is a great place to grow as an engineer."
1810,- Nothing really. Crowded happening offices?,Some of the smartest people I have worked with. The engineers are smart driven and motivated. Uber brings in a culture that allows for innovation and fast paced development. Great perks and lunch
1811,It is tough seeing the PR of the company portrayed in the media swinging from good to bad constantly.  Once the company matures a little in the market it will make it all the more sweeter.,I am still surprised how much impact each day I get to add to Uber and it's mission to reinvent the workforces of today with technology.  Right now its transportation and I'm extremely proud of our values we hold in delivering the absolute best transport with the best service and software.\r\n\r\nThe engineering culture is fantastic.  Very meticulous in the design and architecture and an absolute execution machine when it comes to pulling things together.  There's no place else I'd rather be right now.
1812,Uber is a growing company so it experiences growing pains as our teams continue to grow and user base grows.  The salaries are competitive but not top tier.,"Uber is an amazing growing company that challenges individuals to the best at their jobs.  There is an open line of communication with the executive team.  The people I work with on a daily basis are extremely smart and passionate about their job.  The culture is to share knowledge, keep on learning, with a huge emphasis on team.  The company offers great perks to the employees."
1813,-The pace is incredible but it can also be exhausting,"-Surrounded by some of the smartest people I've ever met!\r\n-The bar is constantly being raised....there is no status quo\r\n-Still has scrappy/startup-y mentality with accessible execs and employees willing to roll up their sleeves for any task, nothing is too small"

If you're in the office late, we'll normally order dinner as a group. \r\nWork/life Balance: Uber will become a big part of your life. Everyone that works here is passionate and likes to go the extra mile. If you're not willing to let your job bleed over into your personal life, this probably isn't the right place for you.","I've been at Uber for about a year and a half and I couldn't imagine a better place to work! Here are a few things I love most:\r\n- Meaningful Work: We get to work on meaningful issues and make a real impact on how people move around the world. I go to work everyday with a purpose and see results. \r\n- Culture: The culture at Uber is awesome - the best ideas win, not seniority. The people are awesome and it's a very work hard, play hard atmosphere.  The culture is also super transparent. You have access to senior management, and everything you need to be as successful as possible\r\n- Perks: Unlimited vacation, gym membership, catered lunches, Uber credit - the perks rock."
1819,"Difficult to come up with cons, but probably work-life balance (not unheard of in the tech world here in SF). Uber does end up seeping into what I think about 24/7, and end up working quite a bit into weekends, etc. but that's also a personal decision.","I came from a management consulting background to the Ops team, and could not be happier. It's been less than a year, and I can genuinely say I made the best career decision moving to HQ and working here. As to why..\r\n(1) Smartest, most intellectually curious people who are data driven and can execute - I am constantly amazed by the intelligence and background of everyone on the team. Some of the brightest people I've met in my life, and I am so lucky to be learning from such diverse backgrounds and approaches to thinking. One of things that was missing from management consulting was true hands-on execution. Uber is about bringing forward the brainpower + ability to execute, and it's an incredibly fulfilling combo. \r\n(2) Hustle and energy - Enthusiasm / Uber love for the product and team is unparalleled. Everyone looks out for each other to hustle, pitch in, and get it done, regardless of what it takes. \r\n(3) It's just fun - I really look forward to work each day."
1820,"- Low salary. Yes the equity should make up for it in the long run, but it's not awesome to live in SF on a budget\r\n- Long hours. Not really a Con because the work is fun but it can be a LOT at times","#1 A truly data driven company where scientific experiment results drive business decisions and politics rarely do\r\n- The rare tech company with true real-world operations that positively impact lots of people (income creation for drivers, convenience, affordability, and comfort for riders)\r\n- It's a rocket ship\r\n- Talented, cool people"
1821,The training once you start is a bit \,Great culture and leadership. Everyone is excellent at what they do. You can learn A LOT. Very passionate team and fun. You can make a great career in Uber because it is growing fast and take  their employees into consideration. Good perks

1823,There's so much to do that it's tough to choose what to work on.,Uber is an awesome company that still retains that startup-spirit despite growing rapidly. There never is a dull moment as everybody is pumped to change the world.
1824,You need to be able to execute without much direction and adapt well to constantly changing priorities.  You are your own boss and must be able to own that responsibility!,"Uber has an incredibly stimulating workplace environment where you are surrounded by talented and intelligent coworkers. Since the company is exploding, hard work is rewarded with new responsibility and the potential to jump into roles that are not yet even created! The work hard, play hard mentality really propels the team forward - employees are passionate about making Uber the absolute best product out there."
1825,There isn't any formal training. It was pretty intimidating those first few weeks but I suppose it makes you stronger / more resourceful in the end.,"Everyday you are presented with interesting, complex challenges that really push you. In addition, I love working along some of the smartest people I've ever met. Really makes you step up your game."
1826,"Cons or not, but not a job for everyone. You have to be dedicated and enjoy working in fast-paced environment.","Simply put, the best job I've had. The business side is growing super fast, and that gives a lot of fascinating problems for the technical side, that I enjoy working on. The best part is that people are smart, dedicated, and hardworking in working towards the goal."

The amount of autonomy that we're given is fantastic and ability to approach anyone in the company with questions is unparalleled. What do you here actually matters, unlike many other companies. You see the results of your actions."

What more could you want?\r\n\r\nYour other employes will be the most motivated and bright folks you've ever worked with. As a result, you'll be pushed to achieve things you didn't think possible, and have the career freedom to see those through."

However, the growth speaks for itself, if you are a stranger to hard-work this isn't the place for you and that is very clear in recruiting and communicating expectations.",Being a part of a high-growth company where you have tons of autonomy and work with brilliant people is one of the most rewarding experiences. I am super optimistic about the outlook of the company and excited to help the growth and grow personally and professionally with the team.

My perspective on that is that if you like your coworkers, and the work that you do, the hours tend to pass by very quickly.","(1) Uber is full of problem solvers. There are so many smart and hardworking people to learn from. \r\n(2) Given that the company is growing so quickly, there are a lot of opportunities to do work that would be considered outside my pay rate at other companies.\r\n(3) The company is really flat - best ideas win regardless of whose idea it is. \r\n(4) People are often impressed when you say you work at Uber\r\n(5) Perks are pretty sweet"

Compared to structure of my banking position, there is a lot of unknown, untested, or not-formalized details that I have had to get used to",Very active work environment with passionate and extremely bright peer group.  Great perks. Great culture. Honestly a refreshing change from my last role at a bank
1837,It is a lot of work. It's not a 9-5 experience and it's not trying to be. But company is working hard to value it's employees and make work time flexible.,"You get to work beside incredibly smart, talented and hard working individuals. That environment is infectious - in a good way! If you have an idea, pitch it and run with it. It's still a startup atmosphere with 1500+ employees and I love that."
1838,"Things move fast here. There is a ton of work to do, and never enough time to do it all.","I've been working at UBER for over a year, and it is easily the best job I've ever had. Great working environment, smart people, and a fun product to work on."
1839,Benefits offered through Zero Chaos sucks while Uber benefits are great\r\nNo vacation time as CSS positions are contracted.\r\nCompany chose to use another to hire CSS.,Scheduling is not all over the place for certain positions.\r\nManagement team are not hawks and are really cool\r\nAssistance to get help when needed is cool
1840,"Not everyone has a great work-life balance, but I've managed to avoid that trap.  Definitely some growing pains, but we're on the right track.","Hard to describe Uber as a startup anymore, but with the rate we're growing there are still many opportunities to define your role and work on super exciting projects.  Execs have done a good job defining product and keeping engineering growth on track.  Biggest challenges are with scaling!"
1841,"- Benefit could be better, for example, it would be great if the company can get caltrain gopass and Mifi (hotspot) for the employee who spend several hours on commute.","- execute fast, move fast\r\n- amazing growth\r\n- great morale"
1842,"Lots of pressure, long hours (face-time is emphasized), little mentoring, conflict between management and team members, very hierarchical structure.  Significant growing pains with the hyper-growth.  Seems to be lots of burnout and many people feel trapped into just staying for their stock options.",The product is great and it's nice that the company is doing so well.  Fun and interesting coworkers
1843,"In the operations side, there is a kool-aid like culture. Everyone thinks as a collective and rejects any outside thoughts without consideration. Fortunately, engineering is not like that but engineers don't make all the business decisions.","As a full time employee, the perks are great; competitive wage, monthly stipend, lots of drinking. It is a very fun and party-oriented culture."
1844,Hours are pretty bad which stems from the hardworking nature of management team; small growing pains as the company doesn't have some of the processes and resources required for a more mature company,Hardworking people working on very impactful stuff; still in its early days and the upside is tremendous; new headquarters is very nice and offers typical tech benefits
1845,"Too much bureaucracy,dont take good care of drivers who made the company what it is now,","Pay is average,Lots of room to move up the job ladder,tech savvy"
1846,"As much a pro as it is a con - there is a degree of uncertainty in working here. The company is changing fast and if you're not ready for it, you can get whiplash.","Work with smart people in a challenging, fast paced, and fun environment - working here is life changing. \r\n\r\nThe people I work with are now some of my closest friends. They are without a doubt some of the most passionate, brilliant, hard working individuals I have had a privilege to know. On top of they are people that I truly care about and feel truly care about me - everyone is rooting for one another to succeed.\r\n\r\nI could not imagine a company that has inspired me to learn more, be better, and push harder. I feel ownership over the work that I do and the growth that I see in the company. Everyday is a new experience, a new problem to solve, or a new question to answer.\r\n\r\nThe work/life balance is challenging, but people have fun and have a sense of humor. People share interests, spend time together outside of the office, and celebrate hard work. We're obsessed with Uber - it's a requirement."
1847,"This company requires a LOT of work. I'm not talking about startup like, you will get emails at any time of day or night, week days and weekends. Some of them you will be expected to respond. It looks fine for most people because everybody is very involved in what they're doing, so most people don't seem to care, but I wouldn't be surprised if some burn out quickly.\r\nThe company is also growing at a fast rate, which makes it difficult to know if things are still gonna be as good in the future ( so far so good though... )","I was surprised about the amount of smart to very smart people working here. The company culture makes it so everybody learns from each other, and at least for my software engineer position, it makes the job much more interesting. Compensation is not competitive for the bay, but people bet on the stocks, and if you believe in it, it is a game changer in comparison with higher salaries you could get somewhere else.\r\nMy favorite part is that most people ( if not all ? ) are truly passionate about what they're doing here and we thrive with the belief that we're making a difference for people.\r\nPerks are better than what they sound like during the interview."
1848,horrible treatment to employees. ..This company sounds very greedy!,Good idea but bad management & ownership
1849,"This position is temporary.  This is a new position, so we  must adapt to changes/updates quickly.  It's a learning experience for everyone.","Flexible schedules for remote employees, great leadership, outstanding training and support, fun work environment"
1850,"I feel that as far as the remote customer service team goes, those in leadership positions are flying by the seat of their pants. Ask two managers the same thing and you are likely to get two different answers. No consistency with scheduling or flexibility. Your experience with scheduling will depend on your manager. Some want you to be available when they say, regardless of your other obligations, while other managers have respect for work-life balance. In addition, there are way too many 12-hour shifts scheduled. This is unacceptable to me. 12-hour shifts should be reserved for those who volunteer and should be rewarded appropriately. If no-one steps up then figure something else out. Scheduling 12-hour shifts shows no regard to the employee. \r\n\r\nFor the remote customer service position, we were trained for two weeks, which is sufficient. However, after that you are pretty much left to the wolves. They say you are free to ask questions, but everyone is literally ghost once you end training. They  have a chat system that is for the birds! During training it seems great. However, you will ask a question once you are on \","The only pro is that it's a work from home job that is non-phone and it pays better than most work from home  jobs. I would add that the job is relatively easy, but that could also make the work mind numbing."
1851,"There are growing pains, absolutely. With a seemingly never-ending customer base that grows by the hour, keeping our systems up to date and working correctly is a challenge. When new initiatives are pushed through, the workload can be a bit taxing.","It's not like Uber is some sort of charity, but we still feel like we're affecting the world with what we do here. In a city like San Francisco, where it was nearly impossible to find a taxi cab in the past, democratizing the transportation landscape is incredibly exciting and fulfilling. The great news is the work environment is also game-changing. Everyone is working hard, towards a purpose that goes past twice-monthly paychecks."
1852,It's not a 9-5.  Work bleeds into your night and weekends.,Work never feels like work.  You get to shape your own successes and watch the impact directly.  Managers and colleagues feel more like family.  The company takes care of you.

1854,"If you can't hustle, you'll have a hard time succeeding here. Be ready to work hard and put in the hours to help grow this once in a lifetime opportunity","Uber is a startup that inspires us to work in eager want – we don’t work because we’re getting paid, we work because in our hearts and minds, we want Uber to grow and be incredibly successful.\r\n\r\nWe debate till 4 am about who our next hire should be, in heated arguments, because we are a family. When we hire someone, they become part of that family, and our Uber family is nothing short of incredible.\r\n\r\nImagine a company wide international “workation”, where instead of staying in a posh hotel and holding conferences and seminars, you split into small groups of 10-15 people, airbnb a big house in places like Stockholm and Melbourne, & eat, sleep, work, and party together as a team. That’s family.\r\n\r\nImagine a job where you directly (read – personally know and) help thousands of people each year. Drivers who used to work in unbelievably terrible conditions to provide for their families can now earn more income and enjoy a better living by partnering with Uber. Female drivers, who were previously shunned in this industry, now feel safe (no cash) and confident (zero discrimination) while driving their car. It’s great knowing I’m working with a company that empowers drivers to feel safe and earn a livable wage.\r\n\r\nImagine creating a more efficient city, where riders no longer waste gas in their own cars, where drivers are directed using a computer algorithm to pickup and drop off passengers in the most efficient way possible, and where pollution in a city actually decreases because consumers are making smarter choices. Imagine being empowered by an entire engineering team that constantly listens to your feedback, and builds tools to make you more exponentially more effective than you were yesterday.\r\n\r\nImagine delighting customers with surprise \"

1957,"Rush, manque de formation","Bon salaire, équipe sympa, bon cadre de travail"
1958,Al ser una empresa en que está dejando de ser una Startup cada vez hay más burocracia. Creo que esto es algo que principalmente afecta a aquellos que han vivido esta transición y no tanto los nuevos empleados.,"La empresa hace que sus trabajadores estén muy cómodos, se preocupa por ellos y les permite flexibilidad con los horarios. Recomiendo altamente a Uber como un lugar para trabajar."

1961,Las tarifas varean demasiado aveces puedes ganar mucho o poco por un viaje que es el mismo y dependiendo tu vehículo aveces se hasta gasta más o menos en gasolina pero eso no es culpa de uber,Es muy facil registrarse y cualquiera que cuente con un medio de transporte puede ser socio la paga es buena y tú mismo te pones tus horarios

1964,"Não é tão moderna, só há tempo de fazer o trabalho que tem de ser feito e pronto, as comunicações internas precisam ser melhoradas, assim como os processos claros. Para crescer dentro da empresa tu precisa de amizades. Não há feedback em prol do desenvolvimento, acho as lideranças desligadas nesse ponto.","As pessoas se ajudam, a equipe em que trabalhei era bem unida. A empresa procura manter a diversidade e ser inclusiva no ambiente de trabalho. Não há restrições muito grandes, no geral as pessoas podem ser livres. Os benefícios são ótimos,"
1965,"Poca o nula oportunidad de crecimiento , no se toman en cuenta muchas de las opiniones para la mejora de la operación , pero en general todo bien","Buenas prestaciones, agradable ambiente laboral , eventos recreativos , buena comunicación con superiores y disponibilidad , vacaciones y más"
1966,"Percebo muito que para crescer eu tinha que ser amiga de alguém, não bastava apenas ser uma boa profissional, dedica, responsável, e mesmo assim sou imensamente grata ao meu período de aprendizagem","Essa experiência contribuiu muito na minha vida, tanto profissional quanto pessoal, meu desenvolvimento a todo instante me fez um ser humano melhor. Minha supervisão era extraordinária"
1967,"Ninguno , son detalles muy mínimos pero lo feo es la mochila que está un poco grande pero para nada pesa , casi todo es bueno en ese trabajo","Buen horario , eres tú jefe , buenos ingresos , y excelente ambiente , te la pasas manejando y en lo personal a mi me gusta mucho eso por eso trabajo ahí me da tiempo de ir a la universidad"
1968,"El tamaño fe la institución misma puede repercutir en muchas ocasiones en la autonomía de los diversos mandos, así como la oportuna y adecuada comunicación dentro de la empresa.","Una estructura organizacional muy sólida, con colaboradores distribuidos por todo el mundo hacen de ésta empresa dedicada al desarrollo de tecnología, la mejor en su clase."
1969,"Particularmente não tive reconhecimento, minha métrica (média de avaliações feitas pelos parceiros) era boa e mesmo assim, quando fui demitida, a coordenadora usou como desculpa, até hoje não sei por que saí.","Ambiente legal, a gente pode ser a gente mesmo, não precisamos entrar num personagem, podemos conversar tranquilamente com os parceiros (motoristas) e deixar a conversa agradável."
1970,"O crescimento foi bastante rápido e algumas áreas específicas não conseguiram seguir o mesmo nível de organização que antes tinham, mas estão sendo corrigidos.","Empresa moderna, que trabalha com um produto inovador, busca um mix de perfis e de talentos para construir uma base sólida. Dá espaço e oportunidade para talentos."
1971,"Sem facilidade na escala para questões de estudos, mesmo ofertando propostas que não prejudiquem à empresa;",Reconhecimento do funcionário;\r\nCampanhas de incentivo;\r\nAmbiente agradável e acolhedor;\r\neventos
1972,"Todas as informações parte de fora, ela ainda tem pouco autonomia no País. O modelo de negocio ainda é muito capitalista e pouco humano. Isso precisa mudar urgentemente num País como o Brasil",A empresa ela é nova então está em constante mudança e o grande feito disso é que possibilita que possamos dar opiniões diversas e mudar varias coisas

1974,"Como qualquer startup, é tudo meio bagunçado, e a gente que tava colocando em ordem. Não sei nem se é um defeito, já que é o fluxo natural das coisas.","O ambiente é muito agradável e amigável, não existem regras muito restritas pra nada, se não causa problemas, é ok. Somos livres para usar as roupas que quisermos, chinelo, etc, assistir Netflix, ouvir música no Spotify, tem festa de aniversário temática todo mês com tudo que temos direito, enfim. Contanto que se usasse o bom senso, nada seria proibido."
1975,Tu pones la motocicleta El mantenimiento de la motocicleta va por tu cuenta Tu pones la gas Gastas datos móviles No estás asegurado Alto riesgo de accidentes,Horario indefinido Lo que ganes depende de ti Puedes trabajar siempre cerca de tu casa La mayoría del tiempo hay trabajo disponible Si te gusta andar en moto es el trabajo perfecto
1976,"A parte que eu considero negativa na empresa é que pelo fato de que as pessoas que te gerenciam são jovens, as vezes falta uma maturidade em alguns pontos, mas no geral é Ok.","A empresa está em constante expansão, então tem muita oportunidade, a gerência é jovem, e te auxiliam em seu desenvolvimento profissional. Obrigado."
1977,"No siempre te llegan viajes, aveces no ganas mucho, y cuando no hay tarifa dinámica los pagos son muy bajos. La app necesita más demanda por que aplicaciónes como Rappi, esta tomando mucho mercado.","Puedes acomodar tu horario, tienes la posibilidad de tomar tus vacaciones cuando quieras, puedes hacerlo en tus tiempos libres si tienes otro trabajo, y no ganas lo mismo pero es un bien trabajo."
1978,Mucho trabajo pero vale la pena,"Es abierta con horarios y políticas, vacaciones ilimitadas, horizontalidad total"
1979,"Os primeiros dias são ruins. A primeira impressão é excelente, porém o processo de adaptação do funcionário é bem ruim. Equipes que costumam postergar os processos de trabalho.

Não há espaço para ter ideais. posições políticas e crenças diferentes do que a maioria das pessoas.","Benefícios para os funcionários, benefícios dentro dos aplicativos, horário de trabalho bem definido, ambiente inovador, as equipes se comunicam bem e ajudam quando existem dúvidas nas tarefas."
1980,"O salário é muito baixo, não há nenhum incentivo para você querer mostrar que você pode ser o melhor, tudo é tratado de forma coletiva então por muitas vezes você não é reconhecido pelas contribuições que realizou e o quanto você deu o sangue pela empresa.","O ambiente é muito descontraído, as vezes podíamos fazer horários flexíveis e de sexta tinha happy hour. Também a autonomia que eles te dão para poder ajudar em outro setor ou fazer outros tipos de atividade, você tem uma sensação de liberdade dentro da empresa."
1981,- énormément de travail ( 45- 50h par semaine ),"- opportunité de se développer\r\n-managers sont toujours à l'écoute\r\n-une bonne ambiance\r\n-une cantine à votre dispo (petit dej,dej, goûter)"
1982,"A gestão dos funcionários é muito confusa e nada transparente. Não é dada chance de crescimento ou mudança no comportamento. Feedback é apenas um protocolo, mas não pode ser levado como sua real situação.","Pessoas agradáveis de trabalhar, flexibilidade de horários, ferramentas para atendimento, festas mensais (pensei muito para todos esses pontos positivos porque não consigo ver muita coisa boa lá)"
1983,"o horario é bem rigoroso, as vezes crmprimos hora extra, nem sempre recebemos por elas, as horas trabalhadas podem ir para um banco de horas,","ambiente de trabalho maravilhoso, pessoas atenciosas, infra estrutura adequada para os membros, relacionamento interno muito bom, pagamento em dia e chance de crescimento"
1984,"Para empregados terceirizados (que são quem de fato colocam a mão na massa) a desorganização hirarquica é enorme. Horas extras a rodo, falta de funcionarios.","Boa remuneração, otimas pessoas. Os prédios dos escritorios são legais. Trabalham com wework que é 100. Muitas viagens e oportunidades absurdas de amadurecer profissionalmente"
1985,"A falta de informações completas sobre alguns processos que serão colocados em prática logo.

1988,Não existe uma plano de carreira definido e gera muita insatisfação entre os colaboradores. Fazendo com que o time fique desmotivado e renda pouco.,As mudanças acontecem rapidamente. Se algo precisa ser mudado é possível fazer em poucas semanas e tem bastante acessibilidade com os gestores.

1990,Nada que justifique reclamação. A empresa está em constante crescimento e modificação. As pessoas só precisam conseguir acompanhar essa constante mudança.,"Engajamento, feedbacks constantes, chefia sensacional, muitas palestras de engajamento feminino, pessoal. Empresa com muitas propostas boas para a sociedade."
1991,"A empresa não possui processos e sistemas internos, ao mesmo tempo quer crescer a todo custo. Assim, a pressão interna é muito alta e a meritocracia nem sempre é tão clara.","Trata-se de uma empresa jovem. Assim, é possível ter uma ascensão rápida de carreira, exposição a desafios incríveis e muito aprendizado em um curto espaço de tempo."
1992,Tarefas muito importantes para um salário baixo. O nível do atendimento é altíssimo além de outras funções que demandam capacidade analítica.,Os pontos positivos da empresa é a oportunidade de crescimento. A cada semestre cresce muito e todos os meses abrem vagas laterais e processos seletivos para outras posições superiores.
1993,"Empresa em crescimento, processos à serem feitos, pouca explicação sobre o plano de carreira, muitos funcionários tercerizados, o que cria um ambiente de dúvidas.","Empresa com ambiente descontraído, pessoas amigáveis, salário compatível, bons beneficios (VT, VR, VA), pagam hora extra quando ela realmente foi necessaria."
1994,"Por se tratar de pessoas jovens, a liderança segue na mesma linha. No entanto elas não tem experiência em pessoas e sim em processos o que torna desagradável o trabalho.","Ambiente agradável, descontraído e tranquilo. Pessoas de fácil convívio, sem grandes pressões. Gente jovem com vontade de crescer!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1995,"O RH é precário e passa por dificuldades mensalmente. Se não erram salário, erram algum beneficio, VR, VT, etc. Os valores da empresa não são seguidos por todos, exemplo é o você se portar como dono, cita com a liderança que exite erro e mostra o que precisa ser feito, mas não o fazem por acreditar não ser uma prioridade.",A empresa confia em você para analisar projetos e procedimentos ainda não lançados com base na sua analise critica. Os beneficios são excelentes.
1996,"Trabalhar terceirizado não deixa com que a participação seja efetiva, pode haver mais inclusão relacionada a isso, pois terceirizados se esforçam do mesmo jeito.","Estrutura, benefícios, relação empresaxfuncionário, tudo 10! A Uber é uma empresa humana e cada vez mais vem trabalhando para incluir as pessoas."
1997,Il n'y en a pas,"Très formateur, exposition, resposnabilité, analyse"
1998,Demande beaucoup d'implication mais travail et projets gratifiants,- Diversité des projets\r\n- Autonomie et responsabilisation\r\n- Relations avec les partenaires coursiers et chauffeurs\r\n- Excellente ambiance de travail\r\n- Managers à l'écoute

2000,"A estrutura do atual prédio pode ser melhor, com mais benefícios para os funcionários para se igualar aos demais prédios que existem. Ha ainda problemas de comunicação que precisam de atenção. A gerência precisa melhorar os feedbacks, a liderança não tem visibilidade adequada do que está bom e de onde podemoa chegar. Aumento de VR e inclusão de VT","Salários mais justos após ajuste, liderança parceira e engajada com resultados e o bem estar dos colaboradores. Gerência acessível e comunicação boa dentro dos times. Plano de carreira melhor desenvolvido e agora mais claro com reais oportunidades. Ambiente bom para trabalho, onde limites são respeitados e também sua saúde mental."
2001,A maioria das pessoas em cargo de chefia deixava a desejar. Alguns coordenadores tinham atitudes infantis e tomavam elas movidos por motivos ou desafetos pessoais. O salário era um pouco baixo. E o plano de carreira era quase uma fantasia. Davam cargos mas não alteravam carteira ou salário. Trabalha-se muito (tempo e esforço) e o retorno não é à altura.,"A equipe com quem trabalhei, funcionário do mesmo nível que eu, era ótima e muito engajada. Apenas dois Chefes eram realmente responsáveis com a equipe e pessoas que nos colocavam pra cima."
2002,"Novos supervisores tendem a se sentirem pressionados e acabam sendo mais rígidos do que o necessário, assim prejudicando os seus colaboradores, por terem ainda essa cultura de empresas antigas. As oportunidades de crescimento são muitas, mas não são diversificadas, acaba que algumas pessoas ficam estagnadas.","A cultura da empresa de horizontalidade funciona muito bem, você consegue trabalhar muito bem em conjunto com outras áreas. Os incentivos de qualidade de vida na empresa são ótimos. Funcionários muito prestativos."
2003,"Extrema diferenciação entre áreas de suporte/atendimento em relação a todas as outras áreas da empresa ou cargos de gestão mais altos. Infelizmente, há uma imensa disparidade de salário e benefícios entre elas. A empresa possui, em sua maioria, cargos com título de manager, o que torna muito difícil a progressão de carreira de quem entra em cargos mais baixos. Os gestores são inexperientes e imaturos e vários deles têm pouquíssima ou nenhuma experiência em gestão de pessoas. A comunicação é truncada e a prioridade muda toda hora (por vezes, não é possível saber o que é importante de fato). Volume de trabalho é absurdo e é muito difícil conciliar trabalho e vida pessoal. O excesso de autonomia concedido vem somado à falta crônica de processos e organização, o que faz os profissionais aprenderem tudo a fórceps, gerando um desgaste rápido. É culturalmente aceitável permanecer um ano ou menos na cia.","A empresa é jovem e muito dinâmica. Embora não tenha progressão de carreira muito definida, possui espaço para destaque no cargo atual e possibilidade de se tornar necessário em outras funções. A gestão é aberta a diálogo e bastante horizontal e sempre há espaço para colocar ideias, sugestões de mudança e oportunidades de melhoria. Visão crítica, quando coerente e ponderada, é sempre muito bem-vinda. Clima, num geral, é descontraído e bem humorado, o que torna o dia a dia mais leve."
2004,seu suporte aos seus parceiros na grande parte das vezes é feito de modo presencial e em horário comercial.,"A tecnologia utilizada por ela e o suporte aos seus usuários, prontidão e ótimo atendimento"
2005,Ainda não há um plano de carreira e algumas pessoas parecem não saber exatamente seu job description. Como é uma empresa relativamente nova muitas coisas ainda estão em construção. Importante estarem atentos ao crescimento do produto para que não fiquem pontas soltas.,"Autonomia na tomada de decisões, gestão de portas abertas onde todos os managers e o CEO estão disponíveis para conversar com qualquer colaborador. Programa de integração muito bacana fazendo com que todos sintam-se bem-vindos. Clima de startup com ambiente agradável e interação pessoas de diversas culturas."
2006,Nada a declarar em cons.,"Oportunidade de crescimento continua, e organização"
2007,"Falta de reconhecimento, plano de carreira não estruturado, nível de atividades excedem ao esperado em relação ao escopo da vaga, escritórios não adaptados para funcionários.","Trabalho em Equipe, grandes desafios, ambiente agradável, gerenciamento de pessoas, liderança próxima, grandes benefícios e empresa de pote Global."
2008,Ainda nao encontrei pontos negativos. Até o momento estou muito feliz com o que a empresa tem me oferecido e nao há do que reclamar até o momento.,É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar. Muita oportunidade de crescimento. A empresa valoriza muito seus funcionarios. É importante lembrar que os motoristas da UBER nao sao empresagados da empresa. Eles são autônomos. Contratam nossa plataforma para conectá-los com os usuários.

2011,"Se você não for de esquerda, sobre represálias e não consegue ter um crescimento dentro da empresa. Não são ágeis em organizar salários e cargos depois que você passa num processo interno para troca de função. Só há chefes, não líderes e você não tem o direito de voz ativa. Os benefícios começam a perder sentido se você não tem reconhecimento.","Há video game, televisão e festas de aniversariantes todos os meses. Os benefícios são relativamente bons, melhor do que muitas empresas por aí."
2012,"Não existe plano de carreira e não existe uma gestão de RH na empresa. Ou seja, as pessoas não tem claridade sobre as vagas que podem se aplicar e quais são as oportunidades de desenvolvimento.","Flexibilidade e Autonomia de Decisão. A empresa dá muitos benefícios que melhoram muito a qualidade de vida das pessoas: almoço no escritório, phone allowance, gyn allowance."
2013,"Apesar do ótimo salário, não vale a pena por conta dos superiores te tratarem como lixo. Querem que o funcionário haja como robô, não tem a menor chance de crescimento.",Salário e benefícios bem acima do que o mercado paga. Horário de trabalho bom. Ambiente razoável. Boa estrutura física de trabalho. Equipamentos modernos.

Os benefícios sāo incríveis e nāo conheço nenhuma outra empresa que tem algo parecido
2016,"Desorganização entre áreas que não alinham o que é estipulado, tornando o desencontro de informações muito presente no ambiente de trabalho.","Ambiente de trabalho, remuneração, cordialidade entre os funcionários, descontração, pessoas jovens e empoderadas tocando o trabalho, diversão entre a equipe. Algo que trás bastante empenho entre os funcionários é a questão da descontração entre a equipe."
2017,"Plano de carreira é algo que a UBER tem que melhorar muito. Nem sempre o plano funciona e em muitos cargos é confuso, fazendo com que a pessoa perca tempo.","Ambiente de trabalho é muito bacana, uma vez que a empresa valoriza a colaboração entre os funcionários, os desafios são constantes e as mudanças também."

2019,"Nível de competição grande, as vezes acaba gerando algum tipo de atrito entre os integrantes do time de atendimento. Pouca chance de crescimento dentro da empresa, uma vez que ainda não existe um plano de carreira para esse cargo.","Uma grande oportunidade de crescimento profissional, a empresa vai exigir bastante de você, isso fará com que você cresça e se desafie a cada dia. Vale a pena."

2057,"UBER geeft je een hoge mate van flexibiliteit. Waar je werkt, welke uren je werkt, hoe je werkt.. Zoals in elke start-up is er bij UBER nog weinig structuur, daar moet je wel mee om kunnen gaan, met andere woorden: het leuk vinden om zelf dingen op te pakken. Je wordt niet aan de hand genomen of verteld wat je moet doen, daar moet je zelf achterkomen. Dat geeft je veel flexibiliteit om invloed uit te oefenen op de werkwijze. Maar het kan soms ook beangstigend zijn.","Jong, dynamisch, ambitieus... De meeste cliches over het werken bij een bedrijf als UBER zijn waar. Maar er is nog meer, hoge mate van flexibiliteit, veel invloed op beslissingen, snelle doorgroeimogelijkheden en naast hard werken ook veel fun met collega's.

2099,"I don't get a bus pass but that's not a big deal. I get Uber credits instead! We get bad press, but it's helping us grow and improve for the better.","This honestly is a fantastic company for multiple reasons:\r\n\r\n- I feel extremely welcomed by the team that I'm on. They care about me, help me, and mentor me in all ways. This extends to the office that I work in as well - every single individual in this office is very easy to talk to and all are so passionate about their work.\r\n- I feel that the work that I do has impact. The technology worked on here at Uber literally saves lives - I can't count how many times I've called an Uber for a friend who was insisting on drinking and driving. I joined the company with the hopes of being able to help other people and this job allows me to stand on that platform every single day. I wake up excited to come to the office every day.\r\n- I feel that I'm in good hands in terms of career trajectory - I know that if I want to climb, that I have the opportunity to do so and that I'm constantly being empowered by everyone around me.\r\n- This is a growing company with potential for so much more and no signs of stopping any time soon - my future feels secure here.\r\n- The perks are absolutely amazing.

Brazil is the country where the population is 55% black. Diversity is accurate.",Uber is the first company I've worked on where you really care about the fact that you are what you are without it being able to harm you as a professional. Since the foundation for the company to grow is to have its employees lavish creativity and love for what it does.
2103,Compensations & Benefits are mostly in stocks instead of cash,Awesome engineering challenges and unlimited vacations.
2104,The pay was not great at all. Scheduling always changed. Management was awful and there is no chance at advancement.,The co-workers were fun to work with. The credits made the job easier to stay.
2105,"I work a 30 hr work week, which is considered \","I love working at Uber! This company is thriving and they are RESILIENT.  I work with a small group of people and they're all super professional and supportive.  I absolutely see a future here and I can't wait to see what happens in the future.

2115,Not good food at lunch or dinner. Free drinks but there were no bottles of water. Need to have more food.,Great company in sf area. Now we have good leadership  with good culture. Overall it's great. Definitely a good choice for data scientists.

2117,"Actually, as cheese as it sounds, i have nothing to complain. Everyone is so supportive, so cheerfull, i'm sorrounded by inteligent, capable and nurturing people.

2122,There are no cons to work for this company,The company offers full time employees many benefits.
2123,The public have a misconstrued perception of Uber which means I  constantly have to defend the company.,Incredibly exciting place to work.
2124,"I'm disturbed by the fact that employees at uber do not have provident fund, what happens when one leaves the company coz its not always easy to save.",Its a big company which offers the opportunity to learn and gain more experience in the process.
2125,"Doesn't feel like tech people are first class citizens, more like a PM centered place. \r\nLot of incompetent senior manager and directors with limited prior experience promoted because of playing politics. This has become clear during recent turmoils: not many true leaders, but tons of people who call themselves leader. \r\nRecent changes feel like meritocracy has been replaced by a bunch of people on the top serving kool-aid on a regular base.","Lot of good ICs around.\r\nDepending on the team, you can build and learn a lot.\r\nYou can related to the mission of the company.\r\nLarge business potential.\r\nGood benefits like food, health insurance etc"
2126,"Still not clear when to ipo, no clear plan to ipo, not sure if Rsu can be turned into real money","Good place to work, started  to increase base salaries, introducing company phones etc,. Change perf review, removed notorious stack ranking."
2127,Not too many. Maybe its hard to get the hang of some tools in the beginning because some things are not as clear,"Relaxing , open , free food and entertainment environment"
2128,"1. The on-boarding process is slightly disorganized at this moment, which tend to leave new employees at a lost.\r\n2. Company's current PR standing is not for the faint-hearted. Negative press coverage almost every other week.\r\n3. A lot of work still to be done on the HR/ employee management front, as trust needs time to build.","1. A fun team and supportive working environment that entrusts you with a lot of autonomy to do your work. \r\n2. The work feels rewarding, because you get to deliver real business impact and be accountable for it.\r\n3. The company is focused in its mission in delivering a solution that makes urban mobility better."
2129,Management does not care at all for you.\r\nThey fire people if you complain about management.,Free meals and lots of overtime hours.
2130,Very novice management staff and management style. BPOs has better way to run their operation and have competitive management staff.,90%  email support and I leave ner. That all.
2131,"The business is young, and still finding its footprint in the world. While it often feels like your career is in a rocketship because of the nature of the work and business is fast-paced,  this can be frustrating in your career if you don't know what you're getting yourself into. Some people don't like a lot of change in the workplace, and working in less structured environments.","Specifically at the ATG, Uber has been a wild ride. There is ample opportunity to contribute and build the company in a way that fits your strengths. When you find a part of the business that you're interested in and needs help, you have plenty of opportunity to take on new challenges. The work environment is liquid - there certainly have been a lot of changes over the course of the company, but I strongly believe all of the changes have been in conjunction with the company's effort to make Uber a great place to work."
2132,Few possibilities to grow. A lot of administrative problems,Really friendly working environment. Good working-life balance. Available free food. Supportive management. Extra working time paid
2133,- Long working hours \r\n- Lack of work life balance \r\n- Does not pay very well \r\n- Culture can be overwhelming \r\n- It can be very competitive,- Career Opportunities\r\n- Autonomy and decision making ability\r\n- Travel opportunity \r\n- Meritocracy \r\n- Having a seat at the table \r\n- Do first and say sorry later culture
2134,-Dealing with people who are severely frustrated,-Exciting workplace\r\n-Fantastic coworkers\r\n-A satisfying work environment\r\n-There is always someone or something ready to help whenever necessary\r\n-I feel as though I can grow with this company\r\n-Pay and benefits (health and otherwise)
2135,It's not super fun when drivers vent about whatever situation they're going through - especially when you don't have the ability to improve it. It can be frustrating but worth it when you can help.,Lots of room to contribute how you want. Truly inspiring people. So much fun to work with drivers every day.
2136,none cant say much of a downside,Pay is great benefits are cool working for Uber management makes its feel like home free food uber credits are awesome Lots of chances to move up in the company
2137,Nothing to complain about so far!,"Incredible employee benefits at a corporate level. Including free breakfasts, lunches and MUCH much more - not forgetting free gear!\r\nAll the staff from junior to senior are extremely friendly and do some incredible work. \r\nA genuinely great place to work - second to none. \r\nWhat you put in, you get back - that's not something a lot of big companies can say they do."
2138,Meeting face to face with disgruntled Partners can be intimidating at times.,Wonderful place to work. Environment is very friendly and inviting.
2139,Bureaucracy and overshadowed by top performers at times.,"Great work environment, provides unlimited PTO, young and fast paced culture, never a dull moment."
2140,One of the cons of Uber is that there are not enough meetings and confirmed information.,One of the best reasons to work for Uber is I get to provide people with proficient assistance. Another reason I enjoy working for Uber is getting all the benefits.  I also appreciate the patience and how helpful my coworkers are.
2141,Working hours and compensation is not good. Tends to take away away much of your personal time.,Working environment and team culture is just amazing!
2142,Dealing with traffic and LOTS of miles on your car ( about 20 miles per hour avg.  over 10 months working).   Weak support system but little needed.,Easy work where you are your own boss. Great pay system with instance direct deposit. Good tax deduction for car expense offsets cost of gas.
2143,ATG will ignore important Uber initiatives by saying \,"I work at ATG--so the environment may be different than at other sites.  I have a diverse team with a profile of experiences prior to Uber. I learn new things from my coworkers every day. I have a great immediate team and a good boss.\r\n\r\nMost of the people that work here are invested in the companies success.  The market for self-driving vehicles is incredibly competitive, and we want Uber to win.\r\n\r\nI am a woman engineer, and I have had an incredibly positive experience thus far.  I think the company is committed to making Uber a better place to work for women and other underrepresented groups."
2144,"Work life balance can be better, but it more depends on person's choice",Great people \r\nOpportunity to grow very fast \r\nLots of challenging projects \r\nRare opportunity to change the world
2145,"Uber is a popular company, many people will ask you what its like working there.\r\nUber has had a lot of negative press lately. \r\nA very diverse group of people sometimes makes me nervous that I might accidentally offend someone.","Excellent Benefits, start immediately\r\nExcellent Uber Perks/Credits, monthly allowance\r\nExcellent Break Rooms, free snacks and catered lunch\r\nClean Offices, Facilities, Kitchens, and Break Rooms\r\nVery Relaxed Environment with Friendly/Fair Management"
2146,Nothing at the moment. Uber is great.,Everything at Uber is as funny as a great amusement park. Every day at work is a new challenge and it is always a grat opportunity to grow.
2147,"Because it is a young business, they are still working on defining their selves and finding structure, policies, and business programs that best fit their needs.","Young business with a casual, driven, workflow. Benefits like catered lunch and Uber credits every, as well as the other ones they give make their employees feel valued."
2148,There isn't any cons here.,"Great diversity of People. There is people from every tribe, every ethnicity and everybody lives in peace with  our differences.\r\n\r\nManagers that care about the employers. There isn't any barrier between the employees and the Office Managers and i think that's beautiful."
2149,Not found any cons as of now,An immense amount of learning and independent decision making at a different level. We can do real changes in the cities if we believe in change and good customer service. Exposure to a super class team who take the business to a different level will develop the individual's personality and how we look at problems in the day to day life.
2150,too much internal politics \r\nit used to be about smart people and smart ideas now its about who can play the game\r\nthis is particularly relevant to oversight from Singapore - heads of functions have no idea how to actually do the jobs they have been given completely out of their depth and dont like being challenged,"People who joined early are smart, and they work hard. \r\nThe new breed, especially management who live off the success of the grunts who did all the work not so much"
2151,"Mostly: the outside image. Explaining to your friends. Having to justify to friends why you support Uber and why Uber is a good company. But if you believe that fixing a problem that causes 30,000 deaths and countless more accidents a year is important, then come work at ATG.","Super smart, kind, thoughtful people, super interesting problems, benefits of a start-up and an established company. In my experience, the media narrative just does not line up with the reality inside Uber. The people here are not \"
2152,"Genuinely can't think of anything, I love working here!","Brilliant perks, genuine inclusion from all levels of business, fast paced and changing work environment, always something to be getting on with you're given a lot of freedom and respect!"
2153,The sctructure sometimes is not of the best.,"Informal place, good relation with superiors, great coleages."
2154,Currently going through some leadership changes.  Fast paced work environment.,A very up beat fun atmosphere. Great PERKS! A progressive environment that is invested in the future of the company and its employees.
2155,"* the negative press can get to you - it's constant\r\n* if you're used to a company where all the processes are up and running and there are robust systems and programs, this is not the place for you\r\n* lack of leadership","* people here are really smart and hard-working\r\n* we are solving some really unique challenges, especially compared to other tech companies in the Valley\r\n* you really do have the opportunity to create impact in a real way. it's easy to take an idea and run with it - no one is stopping you\r\n* SF-location"
2156,Working here can be overwhelming. There's a lot to juggle and there's rarely ever a minute where you feel on top of your work. Hard to get promotions here. The environment is stressful extremely intense. There is not much room for growth because career ladders aren't build out especially in the HR department.,"Free snacks, daily lunch, free uber credits. Very young atmosphere because there are a lot of younger workforce. Discount in gym."
2157,"Sincerely, I don´t have much to complaint","I use to work for Uber, but as a third party. So now, as a intern i feel much more appreciated. The main points that changed are:\r\n\r\nBenefits and salary increase"
2158,Thankful to no be there anymore,Greatest in the car of t world
